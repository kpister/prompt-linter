His work is 20 miles away . He also goes for a weekend\\nbike ride of 200 miles . If he can bike at 25 mph how much time\\ndoes he spend biking a week ?\\n[ Answer ] 1. Identify the key pieces of information : Tim bikes to work\\nand back for 5 days , his work is 20 miles away , he goes for a 200 -\\nmile bike ride on the weekend , and his biking speed is 25 mph .\\n2. Understand that the problem involves a sequence of events : Tim ’ s\\ndaily commute to work and back , and his weekend bike ride .\\n3. Calculate the total distance Tim bikes to work and back in a week :\\n20 miles to work * 2 ( for the return trip ) = 40 miles per day .\\nMultiply this by 5 days : 40 miles / day * 5 days = 200 miles .\\n4. Add the distance of Tim ’ s weekend bike ride to the total distance\\nhe bikes to work : 200 miles ( work ) + 200 miles ( weekend ) = 400\\nmiles .\\n5. Understand that the problem asks for the total time Tim spends\\nbiking in a week , and that time can be calculated by dividing\\ndistance by speed .\\n6. Calculate the total time Tim spends biking in a week : 400 miles ÷\\n25 mph = 16 hours .\\n7. Verify that the answer is logical : Tim spends 16 hours biking in a\\nweek , which is reasonable given the distances and speed provided .\\n8. The final answer is 16 hours . < ANS_START >16 < ANS_END >\\n[ Question ] Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95 . He has\\nbeen saving up his money each month for the past three months . He\\ngets a $5 allowance a month . He also mows lawns and shovels\\ndriveways . He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel . After\\nbuying the shoes , he has $15 in change . If he mows 4 lawns , how\\nmany driveways did he shovel ?\\n[ Answer ] 1. Identify the total amount of money Tobias had before\\nbuying the shoes . This is given by the cost of the shoes plus the\\nchange he has left , which is $95 + $15 = $110 .\\n2. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias earned from his\\nallowance . He gets $5 a month and has been saving for three months\\n, so he earned $5 * 3 = $15 from his allowance .\\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias earned from mowing lawns\\n. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and he mowed 4 lawns , so he earned\\n$15 * 4 = $60 from mowing lawns .\\n4. Subtract the money Tobias earned from his allowance and mowing\\nlawns from the total amount of money he had before buying the\\nshoes . This will give us the amount of money he earned from\\nshoveling driveways . So , $110 - $15 - $60 = $35 is the amount he\\nearned from shoveling driveways .\\n5. Finally , divide the total amount of money Tobias earned from\\nshoveling driveways by the amount he charges to shovel one\\ndriveway . This will give us the number of driveways he shoveled .\\nSo , $35 / $7 = 5 driveways . < ANS_START >5 < ANS_END >\\n\\n[ Question ] Bella bought stamps at the post office . Some of the stamps\\nhad a snowflake design , some had a truck design , and some had a\\nrose design . Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps . She bought 9 more\\ntruck stamps than snowflake stamps , and 13 fewer rose stamps than\\ntruck stamps . How many stamps did Bella buy in all ?\\n[ Answer ] 1. Identify the quantities given in the problem : Bella bought\\n11 snowflake stamps .\\n2. Understand the relationships between the different types of stamps :\\nShe bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps , and 13\\nfewer rose stamps than truck stamps .\\n3. Calculate the number of truck stamps : The number of truck stamps is\\n11 ( snowflake stamps ) + 9 = 20.\\n4. Calculate the number of rose stamps : The number of rose stamps is\\n20 ( truck stamps ) - 13 = 7.\\n5. Add up all the stamps : The total number of stamps Bella bought is\\n11 ( snowflake stamps ) + 20 ( truck stamps ) + 7 ( rose stamps ) = 38.\\n6. Verify the answer : Check that the total number of stamps (38)\\nmatches the sum of the individual quantities of each type of stamp\\n(11 snowflake stamps , 20 truck stamps , 7 rose stamps ) . The answer\\nis correct . < ANS_START >38 < ANS_END >\\n\\n[ Question ] Tina makes $18 .00 an hour . If she works more than 8 hours\\nper shift , she is eligible for overtime , which is paid by your\\nhourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage . If she works 10 hours every\\nday for 5 days , how much money does she make ?\\n[ Answer ] 1. Identify the key information : Tina ’ s hourly wage is \\\\ $18\\n.00 , she works 10 hours a day for 5 days , and overtime is\\ncalculated as the hourly wage plus half the hourly wage for hours\\nworked over 8 hours in a shift .\\n2. Calculate the regular pay : Tina works 10 hours a day , but only 8\\nhours are considered regular hours . So , for 5 days , she works 8\\nhours / day * 5 days = 40 hours .\\n3. Multiply the regular hours by the hourly wage to get the regular\\npay : 40 hours * $18 .00/ hour = $720 .00.\\n4. Calculate the overtime hours : Tina works 10 hours a day , so she has\\n10 hours / day - 8 hours / day = 2 hours / day of overtime . Over 5 days\\n, this is 2 hours / day * 5 days = 10 hours of overtime .\\n5. Calculate the overtime wage : The overtime wage is the hourly wage\\nplus half the hourly wage , so $18 .00/ hour + 0.5 * $18 .00/ hour =\\n$27 .00/ hour .\\n6. Multiply the overtime hours by the overtime wage to get the\\novertime pay : 10 hours * $27 .00/ hour = $270 .00.\\n7. Add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total pay : $720\\n.00 + $270 .00 = $990 .00.\\n8. Verify the answer : Tina makes $990 .00 if she works 10 hours a day\\nfor 5 days , with overtime pay for hours worked over 8 hours in a\\nshift . This is logical and matches the original problem . <\\nANS_START >990 < ANS_END >\\n\\n[ Question ] Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie ’ s\\nlast name . If Bobbie took two letters off her last name , she would\\nhave a last name twice the length of Jamie ’ s . Jamie ’ s full name\\nis Jamie Grey . How many letters are in Samantha ’ s last name ?\\n[ Answer ] 1. Start by identifying the key pieces of information from\\nthe problem : Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than\\nBobbie ’ s last name , and if Bobbie took two letters off her last\\nname , she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie ’ s.\\nJamie ’ s full name is Jamie Grey .\\n2. From the information given , we know that Jamie ’ s last name is Grey ,\\nwhich has 4 letters .\\n3. Since Bobbie ’s last name , after removing two letters , is twice the\\nlength of Jamie ’ s last name , we can set up the equation : ( Bobbie ’ s\\nlast name length - 2) = 2 * Jamie ’ s last name length .\\n4. Substituting the known value of Jamie ’ s last name length (4) into\\nthe equation gives : ( Bobbie ’ s last name length - 2) = 2 * 4 , which\\nsimplifies to Bobbie ’ s last name length - 2 = 8.\\n5. Solving for Bobbie ’ s last name length gives : Bobbie ’ s last name\\nlength = 8 + 2 = 10.\\n6. We know that Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than\\nBobbie ’ s last name . So , we can set up the equation : Samantha ’ s\\nlast name length = Bobbie ’ s last name length - 3.\\n7. Substituting the known value of Bobbie ’ s last name length (10) into\\nthe equation gives : Samantha ’ s last name length = 10 - 3.\\n8. Solving for Samantha ’ s last name length gives : Samantha ’ s last name\\nlength = 7.\\n9. Therefore , Samantha ’ s last name has 7 letters . < ANS_START >7 < ANS_END\\n>\\n\\n< human intent >\\n\\nMathematical Reasoning , Multi - step Problem Solving , Basic Arithmetic\\nOperations , Data Analysis , Solution Verification\\n\\n< expert persona >\\n\\nYou are a mathematics educator with a deep understanding of elementary\\nand middle school mathematics .

The lumbar\\npuncture results show increased white blood cells with a\\npredominance of lymphocytes , increased protein , and normal glucose\\n. These findings are indicative of viral meningitis .\\n4. Evaluate the answer options in relation to the most likely\\ndiagnosis . Viral meningitis is typically caused by enteroviruses ,\\nherpes simplex virus , or arboviruses .\\n5. Option A ( Ceftriaxone and vancomycin ) is used to treat bacterial\\nmeningitis , which is not consistent with the lumbar puncture\\nresults . Eliminate this option .\\n6. Option B ( Acyclovir ) is an antiviral medication used to treat\\ninfections caused by herpes viruses , including herpes simplex\\nvirus meningitis . This option aligns with the diagnosis .\\n7. Option C ( Amphotericin B ) is an antifungal medication , which is not\\nconsistent with the diagnosis of viral meningitis . Eliminate this\\noption .\\n8. Option D ( Doxycycline ) is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial\\ninfections , including certain types of bacterial meningitis , but\\nit is not the first - line treatment for viral meningitis .

Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen ,\\ndecreased bowel sounds , and tenderness to palpation in the upper\\nabdomen . Laboratory tests show an elevated serum amylase and\\nlipase . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis ?\\nOptions :\\nA : Acute pancreatitis\\nB : Peptic ulcer disease\\nC : Gastric cancer\\nD : Gastroenteritis\\n\\n[ Answer ] 1. Start by analyzing the patient ’ s age , symptoms , duration\\nand onset of symptoms , history of present illness , lifestyle\\nfactors , physical examination findings , and any diagnostic test\\nresults presented in the question . The patient is a 40 - year - old\\nman with a history of alcohol abuse . He has been experiencing\\nsevere abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting for 1 day . His abdomen\\nis distended , bowel sounds are decreased , and there is tenderness\\nin the upper abdomen . His serum amylase and lipase levels are\\nelevated .\\n2. Use your knowledge of medicine to identify the most likely\\ndiagnosis . The patient ’ s history of alcohol abuse , the sudden\\nonset and severity of his symptoms , and his physical examination\\nfindings are all indicative of a pancreatic condition . The\\nelevated serum amylase and lipase levels further support this , as\\nthese enzymes are produced by the pancreas and their levels\\nincrease in the blood when the pancreas is inflamed or damaged .\\n3. Consider the answer options in relation to the patient ’ s symptoms\\nand test results . Acute pancreatitis , peptic ulcer disease ,\\ngastric cancer , and gastroenteritis are all potential diagnoses .\\n4. Eliminate incorrect answer options based on your medical knowledge .\\nPeptic ulcer disease typically presents with a burning pain in\\nthe middle or upper stomach between meals or at night , not with a\\ndistended abdomen and decreased bowel sounds . Gastric cancer\\nusually develops slowly over many years , and its symptoms often\\nonly appear in the advanced stages of the disease . Gastroenteritis\\n, while it can cause abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting , does\\nnot typically result in a distended abdomen , decreased bowel\\nsounds , or elevated serum amylase and lipase levels .\\n5. The remaining option , acute pancreatitis , aligns with all the\\ninformation provided in the question . The patient ’ s history of\\nalcohol abuse is a common risk factor for acute pancreatitis . The\\nsudden onset and severity of his symptoms , his physical\\nexamination findings , and his elevated serum amylase and lipase\\nlevels are all characteristic of this condition .\\n6.

Which of the\\nfollowing is the most appropriate initial treatment ?\\nOptions :\\nA : Aspirin and clopidogrel\\nB : Metformin\\nC : Lisinopril\\nD : Atorvastatin\\n\\n[ Answer ] 1. Start by analyzing the patient ’ s age , symptoms , and\\nmedical history . The patient is a 50 - year - old man with a history\\nof hypertension and type 2 diabetes . He presents with chest pain\\nradiating to the left arm , shortness of breath , and fatigue . These\\nsymptoms are indicative of a cardiovascular event .\\n2. Consider the physical examination findings . The patient has a blood\\npressure of 150/90 mmHg , heart rate of 90/ min , and an irregular\\npulse . These findings further support the likelihood of a\\ncardiovascular event .\\n3. Review the diagnostic test results . The ECG shows ST - segment\\nelevation in leads II , III , and aVF . This is a classic sign of an\\nST - segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , a type of\\nheart attack .\\n4. Given the diagnosis of STEMI , consider the most appropriate initial\\ntreatment . The options are Aspirin and clopidogrel ( A ) , Metformin\\n( B ) , Lisinopril ( C ) , and Atorvastatin ( D ) .\\n5. Eliminate incorrect answer options based on medical knowledge .\\nMetformin ( B ) is a medication for diabetes , Lisinopril ( C) is an\\nantihypertensive medication , and Atorvastatin ( D ) is a cholesterol\\n- lowering medication . While these medications may be part of the\\npatient ’s long - term management , they are not the most appropriate\\ninitial treatment for a STEMI .\\n6. Aspirin and clopidogrel ( A ) are antiplatelet medications . They work\\nby preventing blood clots , which is crucial in the initial\\nmanagement of a STEMI to restore blood flow to the heart muscle .\\n7. Therefore , the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient ,\\ngiven his symptoms , physical examination findings , and ECG\\nresults , is Aspirin and clopidogrel ( A ). This aligns with all the\\ninformation provided in the question and is the most appropriate\\ngiven the specifics of the question .\\n8.
