Parse array reference {TEXT}. Give me the array pointer and the index separated by a pipe symbol (|),"

### Precise Array Reference Parsing Protocol ###

To accurately extract the array pointer and index from an array reference, adhere to this meticulous step-by-step procedure:

1. **Recognize the Array Reference Format**: Identify the standard format of an array reference, which consists of an array name followed by an index enclosed in square brackets (`array_name[index]`).
2. **Decompose the Array Reference**: Divide the array reference into its constituent parts: the array pointer (the part preceding the square brackets) and the index (the value inside the square brackets).
3. **Construct the Output**: Combine the extracted array pointer and index, separated by a pipe symbol (`|`), to produce the final output.

### Exemplary Output ###
For the array reference `arr[5]`, the output would be `arr|5`.
