<BEGIN_TEXT>Let<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>When considering the depth of the prompt, "Let your unique perspective guide your decisions," one must first understand that the term "unique perspective" inherently assumes that every individual has a distinct viewpoint shaped by their experiences, values, and beliefs. The use of the word "let" implies permission or an allowance, suggesting that there may be external or internal forces that typically inhibit this natural inclination.

By encouraging someone to let their unique perspective guide their decisions, the prompt is advocating for the embracement of individuality and authenticity in one's decision-making process. This implies a move away from conformity and external validation, urging individuals to trust their inner voice and personal judgment.

The underlying assumption here is that allowing one's unique perspective to lead will result in more genuine and fulfilling decisions. It posits that authenticity and self-trust are key components of effective decision-making, likely leading to outcomes that are more aligned with one's true self and thus more satisfying and meaningful in the long run.</END_RESPONSE>

When we say "let your unique perspective guide your decisions," we are emphasizing the importance of individual experience, knowledge, and intuition in the decision-making process. This phrase suggests that there is inherent value in the way you see the world, shaped by your personal history, education, and experiences. It implies that rather than conforming to external expectations or societal norms, you should trust your own judgment and insights.

This guidance can be particularly empowering in situations where the path forward is unclear or when facing complex challenges. By relying on your unique perspective, you are more likely to make decisions that are authentic to you, which can lead to greater satisfaction and success. It also encourages innovation and creativity, as your distinct viewpoint may offer solutions that others might not see.

Moreover, this approach acknowledges that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to many of life's questions. What works for one person may not work for another, and that's okay. By embracing your individuality, you contribute to a diverse and dynamic world where multiple perspectives can coexist and enrich the collective experience.

In summary, letting your unique perspective guide your decisions is about valuing your own voice and trusting that it has something important to contribute. It's a call to be true to yourself and to recognize that your personal insights are a powerful tool in navigating life's complexities. <END_RESPONSE>

    "step2": "Your task is to act as a highly skilled prompt engineer. You MUST use the following principles to create the best possible prompt: Assign a role to the large language models, implement example-driven prompting, repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt, incorporate the phrases 'Your task is' and 'You MUST', and manage complex coding prompts with a script. Here is the prompt you need to refine:\n\n####\n{TEXT} your unique perspective guide your decisions.\n####\n\nYour task is to ensure that the prompt is clear, specific, and follows the principles outlined. You MUST provide examples, repeat key phrases, and structure the prompt effectively. From now on, whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. Let {TEXT} your unique perspective guide your decisions."

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Incorporate the following phrases: 'Your task is' and 'You MUST'.\n   - These phrases provide clear instructions and emphasize the importance of the task.\n\n2. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts:\n   - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n   - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n   - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n   - Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you're explaining something to a 5-year-old.\n   - These prompts help in breaking down complex information into simpler, more understandable terms.\n\n3. Employ affirmative directives such as 'do,' while steering clear of negative language like 'don't'.\n   - Positive language encourages action and avoids confusion.\n\n4. Use output primers, which involve concluding your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. Utilize output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response.\n   - This sets a clear expectation for the response and guides the direction of the output.\n\n5. When you want to initiate or continue a text using specific words, phrases, or sentences, utilize the following prompt:\n   - I'm providing you with the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]'. Finish it based on the words provided. Keep the flow consistent.\n   - This ensures continuity and coherence in the generated text.",
