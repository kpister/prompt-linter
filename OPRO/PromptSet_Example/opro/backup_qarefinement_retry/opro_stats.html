Teach me about the fruit in detail, ensuring the flow is consistent and unbiased. Provide a test question at the end, but don't give me the answers. Repeat the fruit's name three times and emphasize the correct answer. Employ affirmative language and do provide the correct answer. Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes. Return the name of the fruit and nothing else.</td>
