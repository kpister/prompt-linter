<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Yo man, y'all wanna know what it's like bein' a successful artist? People think it's all glamour and glitz, but lemme spit some real talk. Yeah, there's the fame, the money, the accolades, but trust me, it ain't always what it seems. 

Ever heard of "More money, more problems"? It's real. The pressure to stay relevant is constant, and sometimes you lose sight of what's important. Everyone's got their hand out, and trust, not everyone's got good intentions. You got fake friends, industry politics, and a whole lotta stress. 

It ain't all bad, for sure, but just remember it's a balancing act, and sometimes, you miss the simplicity of life before the spotlight. So, stay grounded and don't let the success define you. That's 100.

The freedom in their lives and the responsibility. 
Avoiding the truth, caught in a dance,
Living in bad faith, never taking their chance. 

But me, I'm about that clarity, never play pretend,
Facing the reality that my choices never end. 
So I own up, no self-deception or lies,
Living authentic, every moment I rise.

In the realm of real life where true answers are found.

Lost in emotions, every beat feels doomed,
Used to be fireworks, now it‚Äôs just fumed.

Girl, I gave you my heart, front row seats to my soul,
But you played your part, left me out in the cold.
Now these tears, they shimmer like diamonds on my chain,
Why it gotta hurt? Why all this pain?

Guess we forgot the melody we once knew,
Love‚Äôs lullaby turned into a lonely monologue, just blue.
Heartbreak got rhythm, and it sings with no shame,
But through the tears and fears, I remain the same.

You see, it hurts ‚Äòcause it‚Äôs real,
Every cut, every scar, it‚Äôs what makes me feel.
But like they say, no pain, no gain,
I‚Äôll rise from the ashes, dance in the rain.

So, yeah, heartbreak‚Äôs a storm but I‚Äôm weathering,
With every verse, every line, I‚Äôm tethering,
These feelings into something more profound,
From the ground up, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm bound.

<BEGIN_TEXT> Explain the principles of quantum mechanics. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Yo, it's Drizzy, let me break it down for you, quantum mechanics style. You see, in this game of physics, we ain't playin' by no classical rules. We talkin' particles and waves, they got that duality, like me switchin' flows. 

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle, that's like when you tryna know my next move, but you can't pin it down, 'cause the more you know 'bout my position, the less you know 'bout my momentum. It's all about probabilities, like rollin' dice in the 6, you never know what you're gonna get, but you can calculate the odds.

And don't forget about superposition, that's when particles be in multiple states at once, like me bein' a rapper and an entrepreneur. Until you measure it, it's all just potential, like all the tracks I got in the vault. 

Entanglement, that's when particles get connected, no matter the distance, kinda like how my music reaches fans worldwide, we all vibin' on the same wavelength. 

So, quantum mechanics, it's mysterious and complex, but it's the foundation of the universe, just like my beats and rhymes hold down the rap game. Ya feel me? <END_RESPONSE>

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Assign a role to the large language models: This principle suggests creating a context or role for the model to enhance the relevance of its responses. For example, 'Act as a travel guide.'\n\n2. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in order to produce content, in the form of the keywords, regulations, hint, or instructions: This involves providing specific guidelines or constraints within which the model should work.\n\n3. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt: Repetition can help emphasize certain aspects and ensure the model focuses on key elements. \n\n4. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions: Please use the same language based on the provided paragraph/title/text/essay/answer: This principle focuses on emulating a given style or tone by explicit alignment with provided examples.\n\n5. To correct/change specific text without changing its style: \"Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should not change the writing style, such as making a formal paragraph casual\": This aims at refining text quality while preserving its inherent style.\n\n6. To generate more creative ideas, prompt models to look at the issue from many perspectives: Requesting the model to evaluate from different viewpoints can spur creativity.\n\n7. Urge models to argue for, and against, a proposition: Such a prompt can lead to balanced or well-rounded responses.\n\n8. Clarify the desired output: Defining what output is expected helps guide the model to meet those needs more accurately.\n\n9. Use numbered steps for procedural or instructional responses: Given as listed steps, the model's response can be structured and clear.\n\n10. Use specific vocabularies or jargon: This guides the model to use terminology relevant to the domain.\n\n11. Provide examples as references: This enables the model to understand the type or style of response expected.\n\n12. Encourage the model to explain its reasoning: Instructing the model to articulate its thought process can enhance the quality of responses.\n\n13. Establish context and background: Supplying adequate background information helps the model produce richer and more coherent responses.\n\n14. Use constraints to direct creativity: Imposing specific constraints can drive more innovative outputs.\n\n15. Set the length of response: Defining the desired length of the response maintains conciseness or expansiveness as required.\n\n16. Express a clear purpose: Identifying the purpose of a response ensures it is aligned with the desired outcome.\n\n17. Explicitly demand politeness: Instructing the model to be polite can shape interactions, especially in conversational settings.\n\n18. Ask for both pros and cons: This yields a balanced view on topics.\n\n19. Use point of view: Directing the model to generate content from a specified perspective (first-person, third-person) aids in consistency.\n\n20. Request the model to critique itself: This encourages self-review and enhancement of responses.\n\n21. Include firm instructions for tone, such as formal or casual: Setting the tone clearly makes the model's responses appropriate to the context.\n\n22. Ask for analogies or metaphors: This can make responses more illustrative and engaging.\n\n23. Define the audience of the response: Tailoring responses to the audience ensures relevance and effectiveness.\n\n24. Prompt critical thinking or challenges to assumptions: This principle can drive deeper insights.\n\n25. Encourage narrative or storytelling elements: Using storytelling can enrich responses and make them more compelling.\n\n26. Specify editing actions: Clear instructions for specific edits can make responses more precise and accurate.",

Specify the tone or style of the response.\nExplanation: Specifying the tone or style ensures that the response aligns with the desired voice or manner of communication.\n\n19. Use role-playing to simulate real-world scenarios.\nExplanation: Role-playing helps the model generate responses that are relevant to specific situations or roles.\n\n20. Use hypothetical scenarios to explore different possibilities.\nExplanation: Hypothetical scenarios encourage the model to think creatively and consider various outcomes.\n\n21. Use comparative questions to highlight differences or similarities.\nExplanation: Comparative questions help the model analyze and contrast different concepts or options.\n\n22. Use ranking or prioritization tasks to evaluate importance.\nExplanation: Ranking tasks guide the model to assess and prioritize information based on specific criteria.\n\n23. Use summarization tasks to condense information.\nExplanation: Summarization tasks help the model distill key points and present concise summaries.\n\n24. Use translation tasks to convert information from one format to another.\nExplanation: Translation tasks enable the model to transform information into different formats or languages.\n\n25. Use completion tasks to finish incomplete sentences or paragraphs.\nExplanation: Completion tasks prompt the model to generate coherent continuations for incomplete inputs.\n\n26. Use correction tasks to identify and fix errors.\nExplanation: Correction tasks help the model improve accuracy by identifying and correcting mistakes.",
