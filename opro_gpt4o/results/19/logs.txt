<BEGIN_TEXT> The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, was a significant conflict in United States history. It was fought between the Northern states, known as the Union, and the Southern states that seceded to form the Confederacy. The primary catalyst for the war was the differing views on slavery and states' rights. President Abraham Lincoln's election in 1860, on an anti-slavery platform, prompted the Southern states to secede. The war resulted in a significant loss of life and laid the foundation for the abolition of slavery and the eventual Reconstruction of the South.

Key battles such as Gettysburg and Antietam were crucial turning points. The Union's victory at Gettysburg in 1863 is often considered the turning point of the war, halting General Lee's invasion of the North. The Emancipation Proclamation, issued by Lincoln in 1863, declared that all slaves in Confederate-held territory were free, redefining the war as a fight not just to save the Union, but also to end slavery.

The war ended in April 1865 with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Confederate army to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House. The aftermath of the war saw the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the Constitution, which abolished slavery, granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and protected the voting rights of African American men. The Reconstruction era that followed attempted to integrate formerly enslaved people and Southern states back into the Union, but it faced significant resistance and challenges.

The Civil War remains one of the most studied and debated topics in American history, as its impact on the nation's social, economic, and political fabric was profound and lasting. <END_TEXT>
