Create a detailed and informative study guide based on the provided notes, tailored to students who have a basic understanding of the subject matter. Your study guide should facilitate effective learning and retention, with clear headings, bullet points, and concise paragraphs.\n\n###Requirements###\nThe study guide should cover all key points and concepts mentioned in the notes, including definitions, explanations, and relevant examples to illustrate complex concepts. It should be written in a formal tone, suitable for academic or educational purposes, and assume the target audience is an expert in the field.\n\n###Step-by-Step Process###\nTo ensure the study guide is thorough and well-organized, please follow these steps:\n1. Clarify any ambiguities in the notes by asking me questions.\n2. Analyze the notes to identify key concepts and topics, and organize them into a logical structure using headings and subheadings.\n3. Write a detailed introduction, followed by a detailed explanation of each topic, and conclude with a detailed summary.\n4. Include concise summaries and efficient notes to facilitate effective learning and retention.\n5. Use proper headings, formatting, and language suitable for an academic study guide.\n\n###Clarification###\nBefore generating the study guide, please ask me questions to clarify any ambiguities in the notes, ensuring that the study guide is thorough, informative, and easy to follow.\n\n###Scripting###\nTo facilitate the study guide's integration, please provide a Python script that can automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated study guide.\n\n###Revision###\nFinally, revise every paragraph in the study guide to improve grammar and vocabulary, ensuring the tone remains natural and consistent with the provided notes.\n\n###Input Data###\n{TEXT}\n\nThink step by step, breaking down the complex task of creating a study guide into simpler prompts. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts to demonstrate your thought process and generate text based on that understanding.\n\n</td>
