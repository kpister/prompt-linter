    Home   Fruit Color - Promoting Red Color Development in Apple      
   Articles  Fruit Color - Promoting Red Color Development in Apple  Fruit surface color is complex due to genetics and mutations, environmental factors, crop load, plant nutrition, plant stresses, and plant growth regulators. Save for later   Print   Share         Updated: January 5, 2024    Skip to the end of the images gallery    Photo: Tara Baugher    Skip to the beginning of the images gallery    To maximize red color, we can influence and manipulate some, but not all of these factors. There are three groups of pigments in apple skin and the concentrations of all three pigments change during the season. Chlorophylls are the green pigments responsible for photosynthesis and are located in chloroplasts within the cell. Carotenoids are yellow, orange or red and are located in chromoplasts within the cells. Anthocyanins are red, blue or purple and are located in the vacuoles in the cell. As apples mature, chlorophyll is degraded and carotenoids increase as chloroplasts transition to chromoplasts. At the same time anthocyanins may increase up to 5 fold. The apple skin has two types of cells: the epidermis is 2 or 3 cells deep and under the epidermis there are 6 to 10 hypodermis cells. The redness of the skin depends on the proportion of these cells containing anthocyanin. More about anthocyanins Anthocyanins are water soluble and that is why they become bleached when cooked. In contrast, the red pigments in peppers and tomatoes are carotenoids and remain red when cooked because they are not water soluble. Anthocyanins belong to a class of odorless molecules called flavonoids and taste moderately astringent. Anthocyanins are antioxidants and may protect plant tissues from UV light and high temperatures. Anthocyanins are glycosides, which are organic molecules containing sugar molecules and of the 6 common glycosides the most common is cyanidin-3-galactoside. These glycosides can range in color from orange to blue to purple. The color of these glycosides can change if the pH of the cellular solution is modified; in high pH the color is blue and at low pH the color is red. When peaches are exposed to water with a high pH, streaking or inking of the skin often develops as a dark blue or nearly black color. The biosynthetic pathway of anthocyanin is fairly well understood. The precursor for anthocyanin is the amino acid phenylalanine and there are seven biochemical steps required to synthesize anthocyanin from phenylalanine. Recent research has shown that anthocyanin synthesis in apple skin and flesh is controlled by a family of genes. Each step in the process is catalyzed by a different enzyme and each of these enzymes is controlled by one or two of the three genes. For three of the first six steps in the process the genes are controlled by light and for three steps the genes are controlled by both light and temperature, but the gene involved in the final step is controlled primarily by temperature. Apple has 17 sets of chromosomes and so far genes for skin color have been identified on chromosomes 2 and 9. There has been quite a bit of research with 'Honeycrisp' to learn why some apples are striped whereas others are blushed. Sometimes a whole tree produces either striped or blushed fruit, but sometimes both types are found on the same tree and even within a single cluster. Research at Minnesota has shown that striped areas of the skin have higher activity of two of the three genes responsible for red coloration. Factors affecting red color There are six primary factors affecting red color development in apple skin and some are related. Genetics Some cultivars or strains of some cultivars lack the ability to synthesize large quantities of anthocyanin. 'Golden Delicious' and 'Granny Smith' are examples of cultivars that develop little red color. Fruit physiological stage As apple fruits develop, there are two peaks of anthocyanin development. The first occurs at the end of fruit cell division, when fruits are about 1.5 inches in diameter. Even 'Golden Delicious' fruits develop red color on the sun side of the fruit and light is required for red color development. The second peak occurs in red cultivars as the fruits mature. At this stage both light and temperature are involved. Light is needed to produce sugars that are required for the final step in anthocyanin synthesis. Blue-violet and UV light are most important for red color development, but the amount of light required depends on the cultivar and stage of development. Light and temperature If light is the factor limiting red color development, then exposing fruit to additional light during the final two or three weeks before harvest will often enhance color development of apple and peach and this can be done by summer pruning to eliminate upright non-fruiting shoots that shade the canopy interior or by placing reflective mulch under the trees. The other primary environmental factor that can enhance late-season color development is exposure to low temperatures, but the optimum temperature and time of exposure depends on the cultivar and critical values have not been identified for most cultivars. Typically several cool nights followed by warm sunny days will enhance color development. 'McIntosh' requires temperatures below 70 degrees, 'Fuji' requires temperatures in the low 60s, and 'Redchief Delicious' requires temperatures in the low 50s, but one day at 90 degrees will negate the effects of several cool nights. The activity of the gene controlling the conversion of phenylalanine to the second intermediary compound decreases within 24 hours of exposure to temperatures above 90 degrees. This is one reason that 'Honeycrisp' did not color well in some orchards in 2016 when we experienced high temperatures during the harvest season. Tree nutrition Some growers think they can enhance red color development by improving the nutritional status of the tree, but most inorganic elements have little effect on color, especially if temperature and light are not suitable for color development. High late-season nitrogen levels cause phenylalanine to be converted to proteins rather than anthocyanin, so high late season nitrogen levels should be avoided. Adequate levels of potassium are needed for good color development. So if trees are deficient is potassium, applying potassium may enhance color development. If nutritional levels are adequate for good tree growth and fruiting, then the addition of any element will likely not enhance color development. Applying unneeded potassium or magnesium will likely induce bitter pit development rather than red color.   Although there are products on the market, mostly containing microelements, that claim they will enhance red color development, there is little supporting evidence in the scientific literature. In general, the only time we should expect improved red color development from applications of nutrients is when the tree is deficient in one or more element.  Crop load Trees with heavy crops often have poorly colored fruit. The reason for this is likely that sugar levels in the fruit are low. 'Honeycrisp' is especially sensitive to heavy crops. Research from Nova Scotia and New York clearly demonstrated that red color is negatively related to crop load and trees with crop densities greater than about 5 fruit/square cm of trunk cross-sectional area had poor fruit color. Stress Most types of stress, such as water stress or damage from leaf-feeding insects, can reduce photosynthesis resulting in poor red color development. These stresses become more problematic when trees are carrying heavy crops because increased demand for photosynthetic assimilates accompanies the reduced capability of the tree to produce those assimilates. What about rootstocks? There is some anecdotal evidence in commercial orchards indicating that rootstock may influence fruit color. A great volume of rootstock research has been published over the past 50 years. In general vigorous rootstocks produce poorly colored fruit because the interior portions of the large canopies are shaded. In studies that were conducted in more than one location and over multiple years at the same location, rootstocks occasionally influenced fruit maturity or red color, but results were always inconsistent. Of the 150+ rootstocks that have been tested thus far, none have consistently affected fruit maturity or red color. Summary In summary, when highly colored fruit is desired, it is important to plant cultivars and strains that are genetically programmed to produce highly colored fruit. Other than selecting appropriate cultivars, growers have only a moderate ability to encourage red color development. When temperature is adequate for red color development, then pruning and training trees to allow good light penetration throughout the canopy will encourage maximum color development. Preventing stresses on the trees, especially over-cropping, drought, unhealthy foliage and nutritional deficiencies is important, but will not compensate for high temperatures or low light levels.

An apple is a round, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus spp., among them the domestic or orchard apple; Malus domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Eurasia and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.
Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. For commercial purposes, including botanical evaluation, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.
There are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples.[3] Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider or apple juice production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.
From 2014 to 2023, there have been an average of 78 million tonnes of apples globally produced per year. In 2023, the worldwide production of apples was 83 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total.[4]


Etymology
The word apple, whose Old English ancestor is æppel, is descended from the Proto-Germanic noun *aplaz, descended in turn from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ébōl.[5]
As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit, including nuts. This can be compared to the 14th-century Middle English expression appel of paradis, meaning a banana.[6]

Description
The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 metres (6 to 15 feet) tall in cultivation and up to 9 m (30 ft) in the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and trimming method. The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly downy undersides.[7]
Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs and some long shoots. The 3-to-4-centimeter (1-to-1+1⁄2-inch) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades,  five petaled, with an inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called the "king bloom"; it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[7][8]
The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes. Commercial growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market preference. Some consumers, especially in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples less than 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4 in) are generally used for juicing and have little fresh market value.

Skin, 100% overcolor
The groundcolor of ripe apples is yellow, green, yellow-green or whitish yellow. The overcolor of ripe apples can be orange-red, pink-red, red, purple-red or brown-red. The skin can also be russetted. The overcolor amount can be 0–100%.[9] The skin may also be wholly or partly russeted i.e. rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[10] The exocarp (flesh) is generally pale yellowish-white,[9] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also occur.

Important volatile compounds in apples include acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, 1-butanal, ethanol, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, ethyl propionate, ethyl 2-methylpropionate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl 2-methyl butyrate, hexanal, 1-butanol, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 2-methylbutyl acetate, 1-propyl butyrate, ethyl pentanoate, amyl acetate, 2-methyl-1-butanol, trans-2-hexenal, ethyl hexanoate, hexanol.[11][12]

Taxonomy
The apple as a species has been given a number of alternative scientific names, or synonyms. In modern times, Malus pumila and Malus domestica are the two main names in use. M. pumila is the older name, but M. domestica has become much more commonly used starting in the 21st century, especially in the western world. Two proposals were made to make M. domestica a conserved name: the earlier proposal was voted down by the Committee for Vascular Plants of the IAPT in 2014, but in April 2017 the Committee decided, with a narrow majority, that the newly popular name should be conserved.[13] The General Committee of the IAPT decided in June 2017 to approve this change, officially conserving M. domestica.[2]
Nevertheless, a number of publications published after 2017 still use M. domestica as the correct name, under an alternate taxonomy.[14]

Wild ancestors
The original wild ancestor of Malus domestica was Malus sieversii, found growing wild in the mountains of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and northwestern China.[7][15] Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed over a long period of time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.[16][17][18]

Genome
Apples are diploid (though triploid cultivars are not uncommon), have 17 chromosomes and an estimated genome size of approximately 650 Mb. Several whole genome sequences have been completed and made available. The first one in 2010 was based on the diploid cultivar 'Golden Delicious'.[19] However, this first whole genome sequence turned out to contain several errors[20] in part owing to the high degree of heterozygosity in diploid apples which, in combination with an ancient genome duplication, complicated the assembly. Recently, double- and trihaploid individuals have been sequenced, yielding whole genome sequences of higher quality.[21][22]
The first whole genome assembly was estimated to contain around 57,000 genes,[19] though the more recent genome sequences support estimates between 42,000 and 44,700 protein-coding genes.[21][22] The availability of whole genome sequences has provided evidence that the wild ancestor of the cultivated apple most likely is Malus sieversii. Re-sequencing of multiple accessions has supported this, while also suggesting extensive introgression from Malus sylvestris following domestication.[23]

Distribution and habitat
Central Asia is generally considered the center of origin for apples due to the genetic variability in specimens there.[24]

The apple is thought to have been domesticated 4,000–10,000 years ago in the Tian Shan mountains, and then to have travelled along the Silk Road to Europe, with hybridization and introgression of wild crabapples from Siberia (M. baccata), the Caucasus (M. orientalis), and Europe (M. sylvestris). Only the M. sieversii trees growing on the western side of the Tian Shan mountains contributed genetically to the domesticated apple, not the isolated population on the eastern side.[23]
Chinese soft apples, such as M. asiatica and M. prunifolia, have been cultivated as dessert apples for more than 2,000 years in China. These are thought to be hybrids between M. baccata and M. sieversii in Kazakhstan.[23]
Among the traits selected for by human growers are size, fruit acidity, color, firmness, and soluble sugar. Unusually for domesticated fruits, the wild M. sieversii origin is only slightly smaller than the modern domesticated apple.[23]
At the Sammardenchia-Cueis site near Udine in Northeastern Italy, seeds from some form of apples have been found in material carbon dated to around 4000 BCE.[25] Genetic analysis has not yet been successfully used to determine whether such ancient apples were wild Malus sylvestris or Malus domesticus containing Malus sieversii ancestry.[26] It is generally also hard to distinguish in the archeological record between foraged wild apples and apple plantations.
There is indirect evidence of apple cultivation in the third millennium BCE in the Middle East. There was substantial apple production in the European classical antiquity, and grafting was certainly known then.[26] Grafting is an essential part of modern domesticated apple production, to be able to propagate the best cultivars; it is unclear when apple tree grafting was invented.[26]
Winter apples, picked in late autumn and stored just above freezing, have been an important food in Asia and Europe for millennia.[27]
Of the many Old World plants that the Spanish introduced to Chiloé Archipelago in the 16th century, apple trees became particularly well adapted.[28] Apples were introduced to North America by colonists in the 17th century,[7] and the first apple orchard on the North American continent was planted in Boston by Reverend William Blaxton in 1625.[29] The only apples native to North America are crab apples, which were once called "common apples".[30]
Apple cultivars brought as seed from Europe were spread along Native American trade routes, as well as being cultivated on colonial farms. An 1845 United States apples nursery catalogue sold 350 of the "best" cultivars, showing the proliferation of new North American cultivars by the early 19th century.[30] In the 20th century, irrigation projects in Eastern Washington began and allowed the development of the multibillion-dollar fruit industry, of which the apple is the leading product.[7]
Until the 20th century, farmers stored apples in frostproof cellars during the winter for their own use or for sale. Improved transportation of fresh apples by train and road replaced the necessity for storage.[31][32] Controlled atmosphere facilities are used to keep apples fresh year-round. Controlled atmosphere facilities use high humidity, low oxygen, and controlled carbon dioxide levels to maintain fruit freshness. They were first used in the United States in the 1960s.[33]

Breeding
See also: Fruit tree propagation and Malling series
An apple tree in Germany
Many apples grow readily from seeds. However, more than with most perennial fruits, apples must be propagated asexually to obtain the sweetness and other desirable characteristics of the parent. This is because seedling apples are an example of "extreme heterozygotes", in that rather than inheriting genes from their parents to create a new apple with parental characteristics, they are instead significantly different from their parents, perhaps to compete with the many pests.[34] Triploid cultivars have an additional reproductive barrier in that three sets of chromosomes cannot be divided evenly during meiosis, yielding unequal segregation of the chromosomes (aneuploids). Even in the case when a triploid plant can produce a seed (apples are an example), it occurs infrequently, and seedlings rarely survive.[35]
Because apples are not true breeders when planted as seeds, although cuttings can take root and breed true, and may live for a century, grafting is usually used. The rootstock used for the bottom of the graft can be selected to produce trees of a large variety of sizes, as well as changing the winter hardiness, insect and disease resistance, and soil preference of the resulting tree. Dwarf rootstocks can be used to produce very small trees (less than 3.0 m or 10 ft high at maturity), which bear fruit many years earlier in their life cycle than full size trees, and are easier to harvest.[36]
Dwarf rootstocks for apple trees can be traced as far back as 300 BCE, to the area of Persia and Asia Minor. Alexander the Great sent samples of dwarf apple trees to Aristotle's Lyceum. Dwarf rootstocks became common by the 15th century and later went through several cycles of popularity and decline throughout the world.[37] The majority of the rootstocks used to control size in apples were developed in England in the early 1900s. The East Malling Research Station conducted extensive research into rootstocks, and their rootstocks are given an "M" prefix to designate their origin. Rootstocks marked with an "MM" prefix are Malling-series cultivars later crossed with trees of 'Northern Spy' in Merton, England.[38]
Most new apple cultivars originate as seedlings, which either arise by chance or are bred by deliberately crossing cultivars with promising characteristics.[39] The words "seedling", "pippin", and "kernel" in the name of an apple cultivar suggest that it originated as a seedling. Apples can also form bud sports (mutations on a single branch). Some bud sports turn out to be improved strains of the parent cultivar. Some differ sufficiently from the parent tree to be considered new cultivars.[40]
Since the 1930s, the Excelsior Experiment Station at the University of Minnesota has introduced a steady progression of important apples that are widely grown, both commercially and by local orchardists, throughout Minnesota and Wisconsin. Its most important contributions have included 'Haralson' (which is the most widely cultivated apple in Minnesota), 'Wealthy', 'Honeygold', and 'Honeycrisp'.
Apples have been acclimatized in Ecuador at very high altitudes, where they can often, with the needed factors, provide crops twice per year because of constant temperate conditions year-round.[41]

Pollination
See also: Fruit tree pollination
Apple blossom from an old Ayrshire cultivar

Apples are self-incompatible; they must cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the flowering each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. Honey bees are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees are also used as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in sufficient number to be significant pollinators.[40][42]
Cultivars are sometimes classified by the day of peak bloom in the average 30-day blossom period, with pollinizers selected from cultivars within a 6-day overlap period. There are four to seven pollination groups in apples, depending on climate:

Group A – Early flowering, 1 to 3 May in England ('Gravenstein', 'Red Astrachan')
Group B – 4 to 7 May ('Idared', 'McIntosh')
Group C – Mid-season flowering, 8 to 11 May ('Granny Smith', 'Cox's Orange Pippin')
Group D – Mid/late season flowering, 12 to 15 May ('Golden Delicious', 'Calville blanc d'hiver')
Group E – Late flowering, 16 to 18 May ('Braeburn', 'Reinette d'Orléans')
Group F – 19 to 23 May ('Suntan')
Group H – 24 to 28 May ('Court-Pendu Gris' – also called Court-Pendu plat)
One cultivar can be pollinated by a compatible cultivar from the same group or close (A with A, or A with B, but not A with C or D).[43]

Maturation and harvest
See also: Fruit picking and Fruit tree pruning
L. K. Relander, the former President of Finland, with his family picking apples in the 1930s
Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Some cultivars, if left unpruned, grow very large—letting them bear more fruit, but making harvesting more difficult. Depending on tree density (number of trees planted per unit surface area), mature trees typically bear 40–200 kg (90–440 lb) of apples each year, though productivity can be close to zero in poor years. Apples are harvested using three-point ladders that are designed to fit amongst the branches. Trees grafted on dwarfing rootstocks bear about 10–80 kg (20–180 lb) of fruit per year.[40]
Some farms with apple orchards open them to the public so consumers can pick their own apples.[44]
Crops ripen at different times of the year according to the cultivar. Cultivar that yield their crop in the summer include 'Gala', 'Golden Supreme', 'McIntosh', 'Transparent', 'Primate', 'Sweet Bough', and 'Duchess'; fall producers include 'Fuji', 'Jonagold', 'Golden Delicious', 'Red Delicious', 'Chenango', 'Gravenstein', 'Wealthy', 'McIntosh', 'Snow', and 'Blenheim'; winter producers include 'Winesap', 'Granny Smith', 'King', 'Wagener', 'Swayzie', 'Greening', and 'Tolman Sweet'.[30]

Storage
Different kinds of apple cultivars in a wholesale food market
Commercially, apples can be stored for a few months in controlled atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly.
For home storage, most cultivars of apple can be held for approximately two weeks when kept at the coolest part of the refrigerator (i.e. below 5 °C). Some can be stored up to a year without significant degradation.[dubious  – discuss][45][verification needed] Some varieties of apples (e.g. 'Granny Smith' and 'Fuji') have more than three times the storage life of others.[46]
Non-organic apples may be sprayed with a substance 1-methylcyclopropene blocking the apples' ethylene receptors, temporarily preventing them from ripening.[47]

Pests and diseases
Main article: List of apple diseases
Leaves with significant insect damage
Apple trees are susceptible to a number of fungal and bacterial diseases and insect pests. Many commercial orchards pursue a program of chemical sprays to maintain high fruit quality, tree health, and high yields. These prohibit the use of synthetic pesticides, though some older pesticides are allowed. Organic methods include, for instance, introducing its natural predator to reduce the population of a particular pest.
A wide range of pests and diseases can affect the plant. Three of the more common diseases or pests are mildew, aphids, and apple scab.

Mildew is characterized by light grey powdery patches appearing on the leaves, shoots and flowers, normally in spring. The flowers turn a creamy yellow color and do not develop correctly. This can be treated similarly to Botrytis—eliminating the conditions that caused the disease and burning the infected plants are among recommended actions.[48]
Aphids are a small insect. Five species of aphids commonly attack apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid, and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species can be identified by color, time of year, and by differences in the cornicles (small paired projections from their rear).[48] Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.[49]
Apple scab: Apple scab causes leaves to develop olive-brown spots with a velvety texture that later turn brown and become cork-like in texture. The disease also affects the fruit, which also develops similar brown spots with velvety or cork-like textures. Apple scab is spread through fungus growing in old apple leaves on the ground and spreads during warm spring weather to infect the new year's growth.[50]
Among the most serious disease problems is a bacterial disease called fireblight, and three fungal diseases: Gymnosporangium rust, black spot,[49] and bitter rot.[51] Other pests that affect apple trees include Codling moths and apple maggots. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal pests like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.[50] The larvae of the apple clearwing moth (red-belted clearwing) burrow through the bark and into the phloem of apple trees, potentially causing significant damage.[52]

Cultivars
Main article: List of apple cultivars
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars (cultivated varieties) of apples.[53] Cultivars vary in their yield and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock.[54] Different cultivars are available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000 cultivars of apple tree in Kent.[55] The University of Reading, which is responsible for developing the UK national collection database, provides access to search the national collection. The University of Reading's work is part of the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources of which there are 38 countries participating in the Malus/Pyrus work group.[56]
The UK's national fruit collection database contains much information on the characteristics and origin of many apples, including alternative names for what is essentially the same "genetic" apple cultivar. Most of these cultivars are bred for eating fresh (dessert apples), though some are cultivated specifically for cooking (cooking apples) or producing cider. Cider apples are typically too tart and astringent to eat fresh, but they give the beverage a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.[57]
Commercially popular apple cultivars are soft but crisp. Other desirable qualities in modern commercial apple breeding are a colorful skin, absence of russeting, ease of shipping, lengthy storage ability, high yields, disease resistance, common apple shape, and developed flavor.[54] Modern apples are generally sweeter than older cultivars, as popular tastes in apples have varied over time. Most North Americans and Europeans favor sweet, subacid apples, but tart apples have a strong minority following.[58] Extremely sweet apples with barely any acid flavor are popular in Asia,[58] especially the Indian subcontinent.[57]
Old cultivars are often oddly shaped, russeted, and grow in a variety of textures and colors. Some find them to have better flavor than modern cultivars,[59] but they may have other problems that make them commercially unviable—low yield, disease susceptibility, poor tolerance for storage or transport, or just being the "wrong" size. A few old cultivars are still produced on a large scale, but many have been preserved by home gardeners and farmers that sell directly to local markets. Many unusual and locally important cultivars with their own unique taste and appearance exist; apple conservation campaigns have sprung up around the world to preserve such local cultivars from extinction. In the United Kingdom, old cultivars such as 'Cox's Orange Pippin' and 'Egremont Russet' are still commercially important even though by modern standards they are low yielding and susceptible to disease.[7]

World production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China producing 49% of the total (table).[60] Secondary producers were the United States and Turkey.[60]

Toxicity
Apple seeds contain small amounts of amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide compound known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds causes no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause adverse reactions. It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released.[61] The U.S. National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.[62]

Allergy
One form of apple allergy, often found in northern Europe, is called birch-apple syndrome and is found in people who are also allergic to birch pollen.[63] Allergic reactions are triggered by a protein in apples that is similar to birch pollen, and people affected by this protein can also develop allergies to other fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Reactions, which entail oral allergy syndrome (OAS), generally involve itching and inflammation of the mouth and throat,[63] but in rare cases can also include life-threatening anaphylaxis.[64] This reaction only occurs when raw fruit is consumed—the allergen is neutralized in the cooking process. The variety of apple, maturity and storage conditions can change the amount of allergen present in individual fruits. Long storage times can increase the amount of proteins that cause birch-apple syndrome.[63]
In other areas, such as the Mediterranean, some individuals have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches.[63] This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals cannot eat raw or cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have the highest levels of the protein that causes this reaction.[63]
Breeding efforts have yet to produce a hypoallergenic fruit suitable for either of the two forms of apple allergy.[63]

All parts of the fruit, including the skin, except for the seeds, are suitable for human consumption. The core, from stem to bottom, containing the seeds, is usually not eaten and is discarded.
Apples can be consumed in various ways: juice, raw in salads, baked in pies, cooked into sauces and spreads like apple butter, and other baked dishes.[69]
Apples are sometimes used as an ingredient in savory foods, such as sausage and stuffing.[70]

Several techniques are used to preserve apples and apple products. Apples can be canned, dried or frozen.[69] Canned or frozen apples are eventually baked into pies or other cooked dishes. Apple juice or cider is also bottled. Apple juice is often concentrated and frozen.
Apples are often eaten raw. Cultivars bred for raw consumption are termed dessert or table apples. Apples also figure into many traditional or festival occasions. In the UK, a toffee apple is a traditional confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and allowing it to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup) and caramel apples (coated with cooled caramel) and are usually consumed during the autumn season or Halloween. Apples and honey are a ritual food pairing eaten during the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah to symbolize a sweet new year.
Apples are an important ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. When cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are often baked or stewed and are also (cooked) in some meat dishes. Dried apples can be eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid).

 Apple


Apples are milled or pressed to produce apple juice, which may be drunk unfiltered (called apple cider in North America), or filtered. Filtered juice is often concentrated and frozen, then reconstituted later and consumed. Apple juice can be fermented to make cider (called hard cider in North America), ciderkin, and vinegar. Through distillation, various alcoholic beverages can be produced, such as applejack, Calvados, and apfelwein.[71]

Organic production
Organic apples are commonly produced in the United States.[72] Due to infestations by key insects and diseases, organic production is difficult in Europe.[73] The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has been approved by the EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality.[73] A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.[40]

Phytochemicals
Apple skins and seeds contain various phytochemicals, particularly polyphenols which are under preliminary research for their potential health effects.[74]

Non-browning apples
The enzyme polyphenol oxidase causes browning in sliced or bruised apples, by catalyzing the oxidation of phenolic compounds to o-quinones, a browning factor.[75] Browning reduces apple taste, color, and food value. Arctic apples, a non-browning group of apples introduced to the United States market in 2019, have been genetically modified to silence the expression of polyphenol oxidase, thereby delaying a browning effect and improving apple eating quality.[76][77] The US Food and Drug Administration in 2015, and Canadian Food Inspection Agency in 2017, determined that Arctic apples are as safe and nutritious as conventional apples.[78][79]

Other products
Apple seed oil is obtained by pressing apple seeds for manufacturing cosmetics.[80]

Research
Preliminary research is investigating whether apple consumption may affect the risk of some types of cancer.[74][81]

In culture
Main article: Apple (symbolism)
Germanic paganism
"Brita as Iduna" (1901) by Carl Larsson
In Norse mythology, the goddess Iðunn is portrayed in the Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as providing apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. The English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples were found in the Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts are still a recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.[82]
Davidson notes a connection between apples and the Vanir, a tribe of gods associated with fertility in Norse mythology, citing an instance of eleven "golden apples" being given to woo the beautiful Gerðr by Skírnir, who was acting as messenger for the major Vanir god Freyr in stanzas 19 and 20 of Skírnismál. Davidson also notes a further connection between fertility and apples in Norse mythology in chapter 2 of the Völsunga saga: when the major goddess Frigg sends King Rerir an apple after he prays to Odin for a child, Frigg's messenger (in the guise of a crow) drops the apple in his lap as he sits atop a mound.[83] Rerir's wife's consumption of the apple results in a six-year pregnancy and the birth (by Caesarean section) of their son—the hero Völsung.[84]
Further, Davidson points out the "strange" phrase "Apples of Hel" used in an 11th-century poem by the skald Thorbiorn Brúnarson. She states this may imply that the apple was thought of by Brúnarson as the food of the dead. Further, Davidson notes that the potentially Germanic goddess Nehalennia is sometimes depicted with apples and that parallels exist in early Irish stories. Davidson asserts that while cultivation of the apple in Northern Europe extends back to at least the time of the Roman Empire and came to Europe from the Near East, the native varieties of apple trees growing in Northern Europe are small and bitter. Davidson concludes that in the figure of Iðunn "we must have a dim reflection of an old symbol: that of the guardian goddess of the life-giving fruit of the other world."[82]

Greek mythology
Heracles with the apple of Hesperides
Apples appear in many religious traditions, often as a mystical or forbidden fruit. One of the problems identifying apples in religion, mythology and folktales is that the word "apple" was used as a generic term for all (foreign) fruit, other than berries, including nuts, as late as the 17th century.[85] For instance, in Greek mythology, the Greek hero Heracles, as a part of his Twelve Labours, was required to travel to the Garden of the Hesperides and pick the golden apples off the Tree of Life growing at its center.[86][87][88]
The Greek goddess of discord, Eris, became disgruntled after she was excluded from the wedding of Peleus and Thetis.[89] In retaliation, she tossed a golden apple inscribed Καλλίστη (Kalliste, sometimes transliterated Kallisti, "For the most beautiful one"), into the wedding party. Three goddesses claimed the apple: Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Paris of Troy was appointed to select the recipient. After being bribed by both Hera and Athena, Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. He awarded the apple to Aphrodite, thus indirectly causing the Trojan War.[90]
The apple was thus considered, in ancient Greece, sacred to Aphrodite. To throw an apple at someone was to symbolically declare one's love; and similarly, to catch it was to symbolically show one's acceptance of that love. An epigram claiming authorship by Plato states:[91]

I throw the apple at you, and if you are willing to love me, take it and share your girlhood with me; but if your thoughts are what I pray they are not, even then take it, and consider how short-lived is beauty.— Plato, Epigram VII
Atalanta, also of Greek mythology, raced all her suitors in an attempt to avoid marriage. She outran all but Hippomenes (also known as Melanion, a name possibly derived from melon, the Greek word for both "apple" and fruit in general),[87] who defeated her by cunning, not speed. Hippomenes knew that he could not win in a fair race, so he used three golden apples (gifts of Aphrodite, the goddess of love) to distract Atalanta. It took all three apples and all of his speed, but Hippomenes was finally successful, winning the race and Atalanta's hand.[86]

Adam and Eve by Albrecht Dürer (1507), showcasing the apple as a symbol of sin
Christian art
Though the forbidden fruit of Eden in the Book of Genesis is not identified, popular Christian tradition has held that it was an apple that Eve coaxed Adam to share with her.[92] The origin of the popular identification with a fruit unknown in the Middle East in biblical times is found in wordplay with the Latin words mālum (an apple) and mălum (an evil), each of which is normally written malum.[93] The tree of the forbidden fruit is called "the tree of the knowledge of good and evil" in Genesis 2:17,[94] and the Latin for "good and evil" is bonum et malum.[95]
Renaissance painters may also have been influenced by the story of the golden apples in the Garden of Hesperides. As a result, in the story of Adam and Eve, the apple became a symbol for knowledge, immortality, temptation, the fall of man into sin, and sin itself. The larynx in the human throat has been called the "Adam's apple" because of a notion that it was caused by the forbidden fruit remaining in the throat of Adam.[92] The apple as symbol of sexual seduction has been used to imply human sexuality, possibly in an ironic vein.[92]

Proverb
The proverb, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", addressing the supposed health benefits of the fruit, has been traced to 19th-century Wales, where the original phrase was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you'll keep the doctor from earning his bread".[96] In the 19th century and early 20th, the phrase evolved to "an apple a day, no doctor to pay" and "an apple a day sends the doctor away"; the phrasing now commonly used was first recorded in 1922.[97]

In apple (Malus × domestica), centuries of breeding have produced numerous varieties in which levels of anthocyanin pigment vary widely and change in response to environmental and developmental stimuli. The apple fruit cortex is usually colourless, although germplasm does exist where the cortex is highly pigmented due to the accumulation of either anthocyanins or carotenoids. From studies in a diverse array of plant species, it is apparent that anthocyanin biosynthesis is controlled at the level of transcription. Here we report the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in a red-fleshed apple compared with a white-fleshed cultivar. We also describe an apple MYB transcription factor, MdMYB10, that is similar in sequence to known anthocyanin regulators in other species. We further show that this transcription factor can induce anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented patches in transient assays in tobacco leaves and highly pigmented apple plants following stable transformation with constitutively expressed MdMYB10. Efficient induction of anthocyanin biosynthesis in transient assays by MdMYB10 was dependent on the co-expression of two distinct bHLH proteins from apple, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. The strong correlation between the expression of MdMYB10 and apple anthocyanin levels during fruit development suggests that this transcription factor is responsible for controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit; in the red-fleshed cultivar and in the skin of other varieties, there is an induction of MdMYB10 expression concurrent with colour formation during development. Characterization of MdMYB10 has implications for the development of new varieties through classical breeding or a biotechnological approach.Keywords: anthocyanin, Malus × domestica, MdMYB10, regulation, transcription factorGo to:IntroductionThe accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in apple fruit is an important determinant of fruit quality. Usually restricted to the skin of apples, these pigments provide essential cultivar differentiation for consumers and are implicated in the health attributes of apple fruit (Boyer and Liu, 2004). Anthocyanins belong to the diverse group of ubiquitous secondary metabolites collectively known as flavonoids. In plants, flavonoids are believed to have a variety of functions, including defence and protection against light stress, and the pigmented anthocyanin compounds play an important physiological role as attractants in plant/animal interactions (Harborne and Grayer, 1994; Koes et al., 1994).Differences in colour attributable to anthocyanins may be due to a number of factors including the number of hydroxyl groups on the B-ring, the sugars and acyl side groups (Harborne, 1967), the environment of the vacuole including its pH or the accumulation of specific metal ions (Brouillard, 1988), or cellular ultrastructure (Noda et al., 1994). One of the most common anthocyanin pigments is cyanidin, which, in the form of cyanidin 3-O-galactoside, is the pigment primarily responsible for red colouration in apple skin (Lancaster, 1992; Tsao et al., 2003). The enzymes operating in this biosynthetic pathway in apple have been well characterized (Honda et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2003).In apple, pigment biosynthesis may be induced by light, particularly UV, and various stress treatments including cold (Dong et al., 1998). There is also evidence that the anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes are coordinately induced during development of apple fruit (Lister and Lancaster, 1996). This suggests that expression of the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes is coordinately regulated by one or a few regulatory proteins.There are numerous reports of the regulation of genes in the anthocyanin pathway by transcription factors (TFs), and collectively these have established that the components of the regulatory complex controlling anthocyanin biosynthesis are conserved in all higher plants (Holton and Cornish, 1995). MYB TFs have been shown to play an important role in transcriptional regulation of anthocyanins (reviewed in Martin and Paz-Ares, 1997). Plant MYBs have been implicated in controlling pathways as diverse as secondary metabolism (including the anthocyanin pathway), development, signal transduction and disease resistance (Jin and Martin, 1999). They are characterized by a structurally conserved DNA-binding domain consisting of single or multiple imperfect repeats; those associated with the anthocyanin pathway are of the two-repeat (R2R3) class. Regulation also appears to be specific to discrete subsets of structural genes, acting either early or late in the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway (Davies and Schwinn, 2003). In the leaves of perilla (Perilla frutescens), coordinated transcriptional regulation controls virtually all steps of anthocyanin biosynthesis from the genes encoding chalcone synthase (CHS) to the final genes encoding anthocyanin transporter proteins (Saito and Yamazaki, 2002). In contrast, in grape (Vitis vinifera), specific regulation by MybA is restricted to the very late steps in anthocyanin production, including UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT), but not the earlier biosynthetic steps (Kobayashi et al., 2002).There are 126 R2R3 MYB TFs in Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh, which can be divided on the basis of their sequence into 24 subgroups (Stracke et al., 2001). The Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 1(PAP1) MYB gene of Arabidopsis (Borevitz et al., 2000) falls into subgroup 10 (when the phylogeny of Stracke et al., 2001 is used), and its protein demonstrates a high degree of amino acid conservation with other known MYB regulators of anthocyanin production. When PAP1 was over-expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis, this led to up-regulation of a number of genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway from phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) to chalione synthase (CHS) and dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR) (Borevitz et al., 2000; Tohge et al., 2005).The R2R3 MYB factors that regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis have been shown to interact closely with basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs (Mol et al., 1996; Winkel-Shirley, 2001). Examples include the maize ZmC1 MYB and ZmB bHLH, the petunia AN2 MYB and AN1/JAF13 bHLHs, and the Antirrhinum Rosea1, Rosea2 and Venosa MYBs and the Mutabilis and Delila bHLHs (Goff et al., 1992; Goodrich et al., 1992; Mol et al., 1998; Schwinn et al., 2006). Over-expressing lines of PAP1 have elevated transcript levels of the TT8 gene (Genbank accession {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"NM_117050","term_id":"1063721460","term_text":"NM_117050"}}NM_117050) that encodes a bHLH protein involved in regulating condensed tannin and anthocyanin biosynthesis (Nesi et al., 2000; Tohge et al., 2005). The dependency of these specific MYB-related proteins on a bHLH co-regulator to activate transcription is linked to the presence of a small number of amino acid residues (a signature motif) in the highly conserved R2R3 binding domain of the MYB proteins, as revealed by comparison between the structure of the maize P protein (which activates in a bHLH-independent manner) and the bHLH-dependent maize C1 protein (Grotewold et al., 2000). Substitution of just six amino acids from the R2R3 domain of MYB C1 into the corresponding positions in MYB P resulted in a mutant with bHLH-dependent behaviour, similar to C1. More recently, it was suggested that this might be a key mechanism that allows MYBs to discriminate between target genes (Hernandez et al., 2004).An additional level of anthocyanin regulation involves a separate class of proteins, containing WD40 domains, which form complexes with MYB and bHLH proteins (Baudry et al., 2004, and reviewed in Ramsay and Glover, 2005). Examples include an11 in petunia (de Vetten et al., 1997) and TTG1 in Arabidopsis (Walker et al., 1999). However, a ubiquitous role for the WD repeat in the transcriptional complex regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis has yet to be demonstrated. Indeed, in maize, the WD repeat protein appears to function in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis only in kernels. It may be that some bHLH proteins are more dependent on the participation of WD repeat proteins in the regulatory complex than others.Although studies into the activation and repression of anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple fruit have shown developmental and environmental control, to date this has not been characterized at the level of transcriptional regulation. The control of anthocyanin accumulation in apple is a key question in understanding and manipulating the colour of the fruit. Identification of the factors that exert this control will provide tools for moderating the extent and distribution of anthocyanin-derived pigmentation in fruit tissue. In this study, we compared two genotypes, the white-fleshed commercial cultivar Malus × domestica‘Sciros’ (Pacific RoseTM) and the red-fleshed cultivar Malus × domestica‘Red Field’ Open Pollinated (‘Red Field’), which is highly pigmented throughout all tissues including fruit (skin and cortex) and leaves. We were able to isolate the cDNA of a subgroup 10 MYB, MdMYB10, from the highly pigmented red-fleshed cultivar. We compared expression of the major anthocyanin biosynthetic genes, and our candidate TF, in the different apple varieties by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). From our apple EST database (Newcomb et al., 2006), several candidate bHLH partners were also isolated. We further show that this transcription factor is functionally active in driving anthocyanin accumulation in both heterologous and homologous systems, generating pigmented tobacco leaf patches using transient transformation methods and highly pigmented anthocyanin-rich apple plants using stable transformation techniques. In expression analysis studies, the behaviour of MdMYB10 suggests that it is responsible for red apple fruit colour.Go to:ResultsThe RNA expression profile of anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes suggests coordinated regulation in apple fruitThe levels of transcripts encoding six anthocyanin biosynthetic genes were compared between white-fleshed Pacific RoseTM and red-fleshed ‘Red Field’ apples by qPCR. Striking differences were observed. For all the genes assayed, transcript levels in ‘Red Field’ were significantly higher during all stages of fruit development than the levels found in Pacific RoseTM (Figure 1a). Transcript abundance in ‘Red Field’ was enhanced throughout fruit development in both skin and cortex, with the highest transcript levels at stage 3 (102 days after full bloom, DAFB). This correlated with the degree of pigmentation observed during tissue sampling, with the most intense pigmentation being observed early in development (40 DAFB) and then again in mid-summer (102 DAFB). These levels were subsequently sustained through to fruit maturation in late summer (Figure 1b). In Pacific RoseTM cortex tissue, there were comparatively low transcript levels for all the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes assayed, with a general decline in expression during fruit development. Moderate activity was observed in the skin of Pacific RoseTM, with a peak of expression midway through development (102 DAFB), concomitant with the onset of enhanced levels of pigmentation during fruit maturation.Open in a separate windowFigure 1Expression profiling of apple anthocyanin genes.(a) Data from qPCR analysis of the apple anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in the cortex, skin and leaf of the apple cultivars ‘Red Field’ and Pacific RoseTM.

Error bars are SE for three replicate reactions.(b) Fruit development series and leaves of ‘Red Field’ and Pacific RoseTM. Numbering from 1 to 7 as for (a).Expression of all genes was detectable in the leaves of both cultivars but was relatively low, with little difference between ‘Red Field’ and Pacific RoseTM. As multiple copies of these biosynthetic genes exist in apple, it is possible that different family members or alleles may be differentially expressed in such diverse tissues as fruit and leaf. To test this, two family members of DFR were identified, denoted as DFR1 (Genbank accession {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"AF117268","term_id":"4588780","term_text":"AF117268"}}AF117268) (shown in Figure 1) and DFR2 (Genbank accessionDT040651), and were assayed with gene-specific primers. Transcript levels of DFR1 were shown to be up-regulated in pigmented fruit tissue but not to any great extent in leaf (as shown in Figure 1). In contrast, DFR2 showed little or no activity in fruit but was highly elevated in the leaves of ‘Red Field’ (Figure S1).Cloning of transcription factor candidates from pigmented apple fleshPrevious studies, in other species, have shown that subgroup 10 MYBs are key determinants of plant pigmentation. Within publicly available apple EST databases (199 900 nucleotide sequences in April 2006); there were no MYB TFs showing high homology in BLAST searches to Arabidopsis PAP1 or subgroup 10 MYBs from other species. The qPCR results for gene transcripts encoding the enzymes of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway were analysed to determine the most suitable tissue/time point for relevant MYB transcription factor isolation. We chose tissue from the cortex of ‘Red Field’ that showed the highest expression levels for the anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, and then applied a degenerate PCR approach to gene isolation. Overlapping sequence alignments of cDNAs cloned after PCR showed that the best candidate, MdMYB10, when translated into protein, shared a high degree of homology with other MYB TFs at the R2R3 domain, and, in particular, with anthocyanin regulators from other species (Figure 2).Open in a separate windowFigure 2Protein sequence alignment of the R2R3 DNA-binding domains of MdMYB10 and other known anthocyanin MYB regulators from other species. Arrows indicate specific residues that contribute to a motif implicated in bHLH co-factor interaction in Arabidopsis (Zimmermann et al., 2004). These same residues are evident in MdMYB10, suggesting a similar protein–protein interaction. The asterisk represents a two-nucleotide change that results in a leucine to a glutamine amino acid change in some alleles.

For Arabidopsis PAP2, these amino acid percentage identities are 75% and 57%, respectively, whilst for other species figures for overall identity are as follows: petunia AN2 60%, tomato ANT1 57%, maize C1 58% and maize P 26%. A bootstrapped circular phylogenic tree, generated using MEGA version 3.1 (Kumar et al., 2004), shows MdMYB10 in the same clade as Arabidopsis PAP1, PAP2, AtMYB113 and AtMYB114 (Figure 3a). MdMYB10 clusters with known MYBs involved in anthocyanin regulation from a diverse range of species (Figure 3b). Sequences of MdMYB10 from three cultivars, ‘Red Field’ (GenBank accession number {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267896","term_id":"82604139","term_text":"DQ267896"}}DQ267896), Pacific RoseTM ({"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267897","term_id":"82604163","term_text":"DQ267897"}}DQ267897) and Granny Smith ({"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267989","term_id":"82547229","term_text":"DQ267989"}}DQ267989), were analysed. Within the coding region there were only minor nucleotide differences, which produced no changes in the predicted amino acids encoded. The only exception is a two-base change resulting in a leucine to glutamine amino acid change in helix 3 of the R2 domain (see marked residue in Figure 2). Both versions appear in the ‘Red Field’ and Pacific RoseTM cultivars.Open in a separate windowFigure 3Phylogenetic relationships between Arabidopsis MYB transcription factors and anthocyanin-related MYBs of other species.(a) MdMYB10 clusters next to PAP1 (AtMYB75), within the anthocyanin MYB regulator subgroup 10.

Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 (Kumar et al., 2004) using a minimum evolution phylogeny test and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Accession numbers for genes from other species are given in Figure 2.MdMYB10 has the amino acid residues that specify interaction with bHLHs (arrows on Figure 2) (Grotewold et al., 2000; Zimmermann et al., 2004). Candidates for bHLH co-factors were therefore selected from the HortResearch EST database (Newcomb et al., 2006). In the large phylogenetic family that constitutes the bHLH type TF, there is a smaller clade termed IIIf (Heim et al., 2003) that has been shown to be involved in the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Two apple ESTs encoded bHLH TFs that clustered within this clade (Figure 4a). These ESTs were sequenced and given the identifiers MdbHLH3 (GenBank accession number {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"CN934367","term_id":"48407180","term_text":"CN934367"}}CN934367), a putative homologue of the Arabidopsis TT8 gene, and MdbHLH33 (GenBank accession number {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ266451","term_id":"82590376","term_text":"DQ266451"}}DQ266451), a putative homologue of Delila (from Antirrhinum, Goodrich et al., 1992).

It requires no selectable marker and results can be quantified by a simple enzymatic assay. We used Nicotiana tabacum to test the interaction of our candidate TFs with an Arabidopsis anthocyanin biosynthesis gene promoter AtDFR (TT3, GenBank accession numberNM_123645). This is known to be regulated by Arabidopsis PAP1 and PAP2 MYB TFs (Tohge et al., 2005; Zimmermann et al., 2004). To investigate the interaction between MYB and bHLH TFs, co-transformations were performed with bHLH class putative regulators from apple: MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33. The results from the promoter assay indicated a significant increase in activity when MdMYB10 was co-transformed with an apple bHLH (Figure 5). The highest activity was observed when MdMYB10 was co-infiltrated with MdbHLH3, although MdbHLH33 also activated MdMYB10. These results reflect previous work in a transient protoplast transfection system in which an Arabidopsis DFR promoter:GUS fusion was activated by PAP1 only in the presence of a bHLH (Zimmermann et al., 2004). The apple MYB MdMYB8 (which falls in subgroup 8, Figure 3) was selected to probe the specificity of MdMYB10 against the DFR promoter: MdMYB8 activity was low under all conditions and showed no activation by either bHLH (Figure 5).Open in a separate windowFigure 5Interaction of MdMYB10 and apple bHLH TFs in transient tobacco transformation assays affects the activity of the DFR gene promoter.The dual luciferase assay shows promoter activity expressed as a ratio of DFR promoter luciferase (LUC) to 35S Renilla (REN), where an increase in activity equates to an increase in LUC relative to REN. Error bars are the SE for six replicate reactions.Transient colour assays of apple transcription factor activityWe have established a simple method to reveal anthocyanin pigment accumulation in Nicotiana tabacum via Agrobacterium infiltration. Subgroup 10 MYBs and anthocyanin-related bHLHs were syringe-infiltrated into the underside of expanding tobacco leaves. Pigmentation was evident at infiltration points as early as 4 days post-infiltration for MdMYB10 when co-infiltrated with an apple bHLH (Figure 6a). The degree of pigmentation increased over the experimental period of up to 10 days.Open in a separate windowFigure 6Development of colour due to transient transformation of Nicotiana tabacum leaves.(a) Digital images of infiltration sites 8 days after transformation with: (i) MdMYB10 + MdbHLH3, (ii) MdMYB10 alone, and (iii) empty vector control.(b) Colour measurement by Minolta chromameter, shown as a*/b* ratio. A shift towards positive indicates a colour change from green towards red; (i) to (iii) as above. Error bars are the SE for six replicate reactions.(c) Microscope images showing anthocyanin accumulation in tobacco epidermal cells infiltrated with MdMYB10 + MdbHLH3 at magnifications of 20× (left) and 40× (right). Scale bars = 50 μm.Pigmentation was also observed with infiltration of MdMYB10 alone (Figure 6a), but not when either apple bHLH or MdMYB8 alone were infiltrated (data not shown). The results demonstrate the efficacy of this assay as a useful visual reporter system to study the regulation of the pigmentation processes.Colour intensity and hue were quantified by measurement with a Minolta chromometer, using the L*a*b* system. This confirmed the visible transition from green to red. The data are shown as a ratio of a*/b* (Figure 6b), where the change from negative towards positive indicates a shift from green to red. It should be noted that there was variability in pigmentation between replicates of a given treatment, particularly between leaves of different ages (Figure 6b).To verify cellular build-up of anthocyanin compounds, microscopic images were obtained from epidermal peels, removed from the abaxial surface of the leaf, 1 week after co-inoculation with MdMYB10 and MdbHLH3 (Figure 6c). This illustrated the transformation of individual cells with the candidate genes and the accumulation of anthocyanin pigments within the vacuoles of epidermal cells.HPLC analysis of anthocyanins in tobacco and appleTo confirm the identity of the anthocyanins synthesized after transformation of tobacco with selected TFs, samples of leaf tissue were removed and extracted, and the soluble anthocyanins analysed by HPLC. When MdMYB10 and MdbHLH3 were co-transformed in tobacco leaves, two major peaks were observed (Figure 7a), representing cyanidin-3-glucoside (LC-MS molecular ion [M+] with a mass of 449 Da; major fragment of 287 Da corresponding to the M+ of cyanidin with a ‘neutral loss’ of 162 Da corresponding to a hexose sugar residue) and cyanidin-3-0-rutinoside (LC-MS M+ at 595 Da, with major fragments of 449 Da [cyanidin hexoside], 287 Da [cyanidin] and neutral losses of 146 Da [deoxyhexose sugar; probably rhamnose residue] and a 162 Da hexose sugar residue). No observable anthocyanin peaks were found in the extracts of tobacco leaf transformed with Agrobacterium carrying empty vector control alone (Figure 7b). To compare with compounds naturally occurring in apple, anthocyanins from the skin of apple (Pacific RoseTM, mature fruit) were also extracted. HPLC confirmed the predominance of cyanidin-3-galactoside (LC-MS as for glucoside above) in apple skin, with traces of cyanidin glucoside and three pentosides (Figure 7c) as previously described (Tsao et al., 2003).Open in a separate windowFigure 7Anthocyanin profiles of N. tabacum and apple.HPLC traces at 520 nm of (a) MdMYB10 + MdbHLH3, (b) tobacco leaf infiltrated with empty vector control, and (c) Pacific RoseTM apple fruit skin. Peaks identified are as follows: cy-glu, cyanidin-3-glucoside; cy-rut, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside; cy-gal, cyanidin-3-galactoside.An HPLC comparison (not shown) of apple flesh phenolic extracts showed that the phenolic profile at 280 nm of ‘Red Field’ was almost identical to that of Pacific RoseTM, with the exception that anthocyanins were present only in the flesh of the former. No significant change in levels of phenolic acids, flavonoids, chalcones or procyanidins was observed.Generation of 35S-MdMYB10 transgenic apple plantsTo test the function of MdMYB10 in a homologous system, apple explants (cultivar ‘Royal Gala’) were transformed with 35S-MdMYB10 and a kanamycin selectable marker. Regenerated callus of kanamycin-positive transformants was highly pigmented (Figure 8a). Shoots regenerated from this callus maintained colour, whilst control plants transformed with an empty vector consistently showed no pigmentation at either the callus or regenerated shoot stages. qPCR analysis confirmed a massive elevation of MdMYB10 transcript level but no apparent elevation in either MdbHLH3 or MdbHLH33 transcript levels (Figure S2). The suggestion that different gene family members of biosynthetic enzymes are leaf- or fruit-specific was confirmed in these transgenic plants. MdDFR1 showed a slight increase in transcript levels in the 35S-MdMYB10 transgenic lines compared to the control plants, and MdDFR2 showed even higher levels (Figure S1). HPLC analysis of MdMYB10 transgenic apple leaves showed a predominant peak of cyanidin-3-galactoside (Figure 8b) and confirmed the presence of smaller amounts of cyanidin glucoside and three derivatives of cyanidin pentoside.Open in a separate windowFigure 8Over-expression of MdMYB10 in apple elevates anthocyanin production.(a) Pigmented callus (i) and apple plants (ii) transformed with 35S-MdMYB10 (left) and empty vector control plant (right).(b) Anthocyanin profiles of extracts of 35S-MdMYB10 apple leaf (top line) and empty vector control (bottom line). Peaks identified from HPLC traces at 520 nm: cy-gal, cyanidin-3-galactoside; with minor traces of cy-glu, cyanidin-3-glucoside and cy-pent, cyanidin-3-pentoside.Quantitative PCR expression analysis of MdMYB10 in apple fruitqPCR analysis of the expression of TF gene transcripts in the developmental series from both red- and white-fleshed varieties of apple revealed massive increases in the relative transcript levels of MdMYB10 in the fruit tissues of ‘Red Field’ compared with Pacific RoseTM (Figure 9). In Pacific RoseTM cortex, transcript levels were barely detectable, whilst in Pacific RoseTM skin, transcript was detectable only by mid-season (Figure 9), and the level of transcript correlated with changes in the transcript levels of the biosynthetic genes, particularly at the 102 DAFB time point. The link between MdMYB10 expression and UFGT expression was particularly strong (Figure 1a). Expression levels of MdMYB10 in ‘Red Field’ generally followed the transcript patterns of the assayed genes encoding enzymes, with highly elevated levels throughout fruit tissues, particularly at 40 DAFB and then again at 102, 130 and 146 DAFB (Figure 9) and in leaf tissue. To confirm specificity, qPCR amplicons were sequenced and found to encode MdMYB10.Open in a separate windowFigure 9Expression analysis of the transcripts of MdMYB10, MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33 during apple fruit development and in leaves.(a) RT-PCR analysis of MdMYB10 (220 bp) and actin (131 bp) in ‘Red Field’ (cortex, skin and leaf) and Pacific RoseTM (cortex, skin and leaf), and corresponding qPCR data for MdMYB10 (b), MdbHLH3 (c) and MdbHLH33 (d). Gel lane and x axis numbering as follows: (1) 40 DAFB, (2) 67 DAFB, (3) 102 DAFB, (4) 130 DAFB, (5) 146 DAFB, (6) ‘Red Field’ leaf and (7) Pacific RoseTM leaf. Error bars shown in qPCR data are of the SE for three replicate reactions.Transcript levels of MdbHLH3 and MdbHLH33 were also assayed (Figure 9c,d) but did not appear to follow the pattern displayed for the biosynthetic genes, or for MdMYB10, with more consistent levels of expression throughout the developmental series and in both cultivars. Again, amplicons were sequenced to verify authenticity. Transcript levels of MdMYB8 (GenBank accession number {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267899","term_id":"82604208","term_text":"DQ267899"}}DQ267899), an apple MYB unrelated to the anthocyanin subgroup 10 (Figure 3), were also analysed and no correlative patterns with the transcript levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes were observed (data not shown).Go to:DiscussionApple anthocyanin biosynthesis is coordinately regulatedModern domesticated cultivars of apple show differential anthocyanin accumulation during development. Specific anthocyanin pigments accumulate in floral tissues and during fruit maturation in apple skin. Environmental factors also cause increases in the expression of genes encoding anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes, as demonstrated by their responsiveness to light (Kim et al., 2003). It is possible that white-fleshed apples have lost the ability to produce pigmentation throughout the fruit due to a mutation in one or more biosynthetic gene(s), or in the regulatory genes as has been observed for white grapes (Boss et al., 1996). In terms of the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes, we detected some transcript in both cortex and skin of white-fleshed Pacific RoseTM, but at low levels (Figure 1a). A previous study in apple showed that all the late anthocyanin biosynthetic genes are present in the genome of a green cultivar but that transcripts were barely detectable by RNA gel-blot analysis (Kim et al., 2003). Our data differ from these results in that we were able to detect expression of at least six genes, including the late biosynthetic genes, in non-pigmented apple cortex. This is probably due to the enhanced sensitivity of qPCR over RNA gel-blot analysis. In grape, it has been shown that the only difference in expression of the biosynthetic genes in red grape skin versus white grape skin was the loss of expression of UFGT in the latter (Boss et al., 1996).The anthocyanin genes in ‘Red Field’ followed a pattern whereby the expression levels of the biosynthetic gene transcripts peaked at 102 and 130 DAFB. There were large increases in all expressed genes in the red-fleshed compared to the white-fleshed cultivar. Only CHS differed significantly from this general pattern, with the highest expression seen early in the development of ‘Red Field’ fruit skin (40 DAFB), although expression did rise again at 102 DAFB. It is likely that at least some of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes are differentially expressed according to tissue type. This is demonstrated by the transcript levels of the two versions of DFR measured: MdDFR1 showed a large variation in differently pigmented fruit tissues but not in differently pigmented leaf tissue, whilst MdDFR2 demonstrated the reverse.Transcription factors controlling apple colourSequence analysis of the MdMYB10-encoded protein showed that it shares homology with anthocyanin-regulating MYB TFs from other species (Figure 2). Its probable orthology to PAP1 is supported by its position in the same clade of the MYB TF family (Figure 3a). Further analysis of MdMYB10 cDNAs from two other apple cultivars showed a high degree of sequence conservation between such strikingly different varieties as ‘Granny Smith’ (white cortex and predominantly green skin) and the highly pigmented ‘Red Field’. In grape, a retrotransposon-induced insertion into the gene encoding the grape MYB-related VvmybA1 TF has resulted in a lack of anthocyanin production, generating white grape cultivars (Kobayashi et al., 2004). The similarity between the sequences of MdMYB10 in these three apple cultivars suggests that the dramatic difference in anthocyanin accumulation in apple is not due to alterations in the coding sequence of this regulator. However, the difference in anthocyanin accumulation appears to be due to differences in the expression levels and pattern of MdMYB10 in the two varieties.Expression analysis of MdMYB10 showed a pattern very similar to that observed for the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes in ‘Red Field’ apples. A large increase in expression of MdMYB10 in the fruit of this variety suggests that it is likely to be the regulator of the apple anthocyanin pathway. This association is further strengthened by expression analysis of MdMYB10 in Pacific RoseTM; it was virtually undetectable in leaf and cortex but was expressed in the pigmented skin, particularly at 102 DAFB, when colour was developing. We did not detect evidence for increased transcript levels for the two bHLH genes assayed, suggesting that, in apple, neither of these genes is positively regulated by MdMYB10. This is in contrast to the results for over-expressing PAP1 in Arabidopsis (Tohge et al., 2005), where PAP1 appears to up-regulate its bHLH interactor. The proposed model for TTG1-dependent (WD40-containing) transcriptional networks (Zhang et al., 2003) predicts increasing specificity moving down the hierarchy from WD40 through the bHLHs and down to the MYBs. Mutations in TTG1 (encoding a WD40-containing protein) affect both anthocyanin levels and epidermal cell fate (Walker et al., 1999). The MYB component of this WD40–bHLH–MYB complex appears to provide the most anthocyanin-specific effect. Our data suggest that, in apple, the MYB component, MdMYB10, is the limiting feature for pigment accumulation.Evidence for MYB:bHLH interactionA signature motif for the interaction between MYB and bHLH proteins, based on specific residues within the R2R3 DNA-binding domain of the MYB partner, has been proposed for maize and Arabidopsis and confirmed experimentally (Grotewold et al., 2000; Zimmermann et al., 2004). MdMYB10 shares a similar residue pattern to the bHLH-dependent maize C1 protein (unlike the bHLH-independent maize MYB-related P protein). We identified the interaction signature motif in MdMYB10, and confirmed, using transient assays, that the protein interacts with bHLH proteins to activate transcription of DFR.The results from transient assays in tobacco showed interaction between MdMYB10 and two selected apple bHLH candidates (Figures 5 and ​and6).6). Whilst MdbHLH3, when co-infiltrated with MdMYB10, does appear to have a greater effect than MdbHLH33 on the activity of the DFR promoter (Figure 5), further work is required to confirm whether either of these associations is significant in apple tissue. One possible reason for a background level of anthocyanin accumulation with MdMYB10 alone may be because there is an endogenous tobacco bHLH protein working within this transient assay. Using this assay, transient expression demonstrated that MdMYB10 is effective at driving anthocyanin accumulation (Figure 6). In the presence of an apple co-activator, this accumulation was intensified and the colour appeared several days earlier, demonstrating partial dependence of MdMYB10 activity on the presence of an apple bHLH protein in this heterologous system.Tobacco foliar anthocyanin accumulationWe have used transient transformation of tobacco leaves as an assay for the anthocyanin pathway. HPLC data and microscopy show significant accumulation of anthocyanin compounds, driven by MdMYB10 and a bHLH, confirming the functional presence of anthocyanin biosynthetic enzymes in tobacco leaves and the cellular machinery required to transport anthocyanins to the vacuole. Transient expression of MdMYB10 in tobacco results in major anthocyanin peaks representing cyanidin-3-galactoside and cyanidin-3-0-rutinoside. Accumulation of an alternative compound to that normally observed in apple is a probable consequence of differences in the genes encoding the biosynthetic enzymes available in the two species. However, this apple TF-driven enhancement ably demonstrates the proposed conservation of MYB regulators between the species.Anthocyanin accumulation in 35S-MdMYB10 apple and the ‘Red Field’ red-fleshed cultivarOver-expression of MdMYB10 in apple generated a strong phenotype, with highly pigmented plants (Figure 8) due to enhanced levels of anthocyanin. No anthocyanin was detected in control plants by HPLC analysis in contrast to the considerable level of anthocyanins in the MdMYB10 plants. The effect of MdMYB10 over-expression on the pigmentation of fruit cortex will be apparent when these plantlets have fruited. In naturally occurring red-fleshed apples, high levels of MdMYB10 expression appear to be the cause of this startling phenotype (Figure 9). Further, genetic mapping of an MdMYB10-derived molecular marker indicates that this locus co-segregates with the red-fleshed apple phenotype (D. Chagné, HortResearch, Auckland, New Zealand, personal communication).ConclusionThe combination of bioinformatic, expression and functional data suggests that MdMYB10 is the apple orthologue of known anthocyanin regulators from other species, such as Arabidopsis PAP1. Over-expression of MdMYB10 in apple is reminiscent of PAP1 transgenic Arabidopsis plants (Borevitz et al., 2000; Xie et al., 2006). Isolation of this gene provides a crucial step in understanding the molecular regulation of anthocyanin gene transcription in apple fruit. The high levels of expression of MdMYB10 in the cortex of the red apple variety ‘Red Field’ suggest that it is differences in the activity of this gene that determine the colour differences between the cortex tissues in these varieties. These differences in activity appear to result from differences in expression of the MdMYB10 gene, as the coding sequences of this gene are virtually identical in the two varieties. Once again, a MYB transcription factor appears to be the primary determinant of differences in colour between cultivated plant varieties, as has been reported for potato, tomato, pepper (De Jong et al., 2004) and grape (Kobayashi et al., 2004), and in various species of Antirrhinum (Schwinn et al., 2006). These results confirm the previous findings that it is the MYB component from the proposed regulatory complex of MYB–bHLH–WD40 that is primarily (and specifically) responsible for the level of anthocyanin accumulation. Our elucidation of the primary molecular control of colour in apple provides important information for the breeding of apples with coloured flesh.Go to:Experimental proceduresReal-time qPCR expression analysisApple fruit were collected at six time points during the season from spring through to late summer (2003–2004): stage 1, 7 days after full bloom (DAFB); stage 2, 40 DAFB; stage 3, 67 DAFB; stage 4, 102 DAFB; stage 5, 130 DAFB; stage 6, 146 DAFB, from trees at the HortResearch orchard (Nelson, New Zealand). RNA was isolated (by a method adapted from that described by Chang et al., 1993) from the fruit (six fruit from the same tree, skin and cortex separately) and the leaves of two genotypes: the white-fleshed commercial cultivar Malus × domestica‘Sciros’ (Pacific RoseTM, derived from a cross between ‘Gala’ and ‘Splendour’), and an open-pollinated red-fleshed seedling of Malus × domestica‘Red Field’ (a cross between ‘Wolf River’ and Malus × domestica niedzwetzkyana; Brooks and Olmo, 1972). For the first developmental fruit time point (7 DAFB), successful excision of skin from cortex was not possible, so data from this sample have been excluded. Following DNase treatment, first-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out in triplicate for each sample (to minimize variation in RNA template levels) using oligo(dT) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Transcriptor; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Samples were then pooled.Genes encoding apple anthocyanin pathway enzymes and regulators were identified by homology in the HortResearch EST database, and, where putative gene family members existed, candidates were selected when they appeared in fruit library tissues. Gene-specific primers corresponding to these genes were designed using Vector NTI version 9.0.0 (http://www.invitrogen.com) to a stringent set of criteria, enabling application of universal reaction conditions. To check reaction specificity, RT-PCR reactions were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Platinum Taq, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), with a thermal profile as follows: pre-incubation at 95°C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95°C (30 sec), 60°C (30 sec) and 72°C (30 sec), with a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The sequences of each primer pair and the relevant accession numbers are shown in Table S1.qPCR DNA amplification and analysis was carried out using the LightCycler System (Roche LightCycler 1.5; Roche Diagnostics). All reactions were performed using the LightCycler FastStart SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics) according to the procedure described by the manufacturer. Reactions were performed in triplicate using 2 μl 5 × Master Mix, 0.5 μm each primer, 1 μl diluted cDNA and nuclease-free water (Roche Diagnostics) to a final volume of 10 μl. A negative water control was included in each run. Fluorescence was measured at the end of each annealing step. Amplification was followed by a melting curve analysis with continual fluorescence data acquisition during the 65–95°C melt. The raw data were analysed with the LightCycler software, version 4, and expression was normalized to Malus × domestica actin (MdActin, accession number {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"CN938023","term_id":"48410836","term_text":"CN938023"}}CN938023) to minimize variation in cDNA template levels, with the Pacific RoseTM leaf sample acting as calibrator with a nominal value of 1. MdActin was selected for normalization due to its consistent transcript level throughout fruit tissues and leaf, with crossing threshold (Ct) values changing by < 2. For each gene, a standard curve was generated using a cDNA serial dilution, and the resultant PCR efficiency calculations (ranging between 1.839 and 1.945) were imported into relative expression data analysis. To ensure that the transcripts of single genes had been amplified, qPCR amplicons were sequenced and confirmed as the expected plant DNA sequences. Error bars shown in qPCR data are technical replicates, representing the means ± SE of three replicate qPCR reactions.Isolation of MdMYB10PCR was performed using cDNA from the cortex sample of ‘Red Field’ (102 DAFB) using degenerate primers (with a 32-fold degeneracy) designed to the consensus DNA sequence of the R2R3 DNA-binding domain based on the sequence of anthocyanin regulators in diverse species. Numerous cDNAs encoding R2R3 MYB domains were obtained. Results from sequencing data revealed one cDNA with high identity to anthocyanin regulators, and the full-length sequence was obtained using 5′ RACE (GeneRacer, Invitrogen). The complete sequence for the MdMYB10 cDNA was compiled from overlapping fragments (Genbank accession number {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267896","term_id":"82604139","term_text":"DQ267896"}}DQ267896). To compare the transcript from ‘Red Field’, full-length cDNAs were subsequently isolated from Malus × domestica Pacific RoseTM ({"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267897","term_id":"82604163","term_text":"DQ267897"}}DQ267897) and ‘Granny Smith’ ({"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267898","term_id":"82604188","term_text":"DQ267898"}}DQ267898). cDNA of MdMYB8 ({"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"DQ267899","term_id":"82604208","term_text":"DQ267899"}}DQ267899), an apple MYB bearing little sequence homology to known anthocyanin regulators, was isolated from the HortResearch EST collection to act as a negative control.Dual luciferase assay of transiently transformed tobacco leavesThe promoter sequence for Arabidopsis DFR was inserted into the cloning site of pGreen 0800-LUC (Figure S3) (Hellens et al., 2005) and modified to introduce an NcoI site at the 3′ end of the sequence, allowing the promoter to be cloned as a transcriptional fusion with the firefly luciferase gene (LUC). Thus, TFs that bind the promoter and increase the rate of transcription could be identified as an increase in luminescence activity. Arabidopsis DFR (TT3, AT5g42800) was isolated from genomic Arabidopsis DNA. In the same construct, a luciferase gene from Renilla (REN), under the control of a 35S promoter, provided an estimate of the extent of transient expression. Activity is expressed as a ratio of LUC to REN activity such that where interaction between a TF (with or without bHLH) and the promoter occurred, a significant increase in LUC activity relative to REN would be observed.The promoter–LUC fusion in pGreenII 0800-LUC was used in transient transformation by mixing 100 μl of Agrobacterium strain GV3101 (MP90) transformed with the reporter cassette with 450 μl each of two other Agrobacterium cultures transformed with cassettes containing a MYB TF gene fused to the 35S promoter and a bHLH TF gene in either pART27 (Gleave, 1992) or pGreenII 62-SK binary vectors (Figure S4) (Hellens et al., 2000).Nicotiana tabacum‘Samsun’ plants were grown under glasshouse conditions in full potting mix, using natural light with daylight extension to 16 h, until at least six leaves were available for infiltration with Agrobacterium. Plants were maintained in the glasshouse for the duration of the experiment. Agrobacterium was cultured on Lennox agar (Invitrogen) supplemented with selection antibiotics and incubated at 28°C. A 10 μl loop of confluent bacterium was re-suspended in 10 ml of infiltration buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 μm acetosyringone) to an OD600 of 0.2, and incubated at room temperature without shaking for 2 h before infiltration. Infiltrations were performed according to the methods described by Voinnet et al. (2003). Approximately 150 μl of this Agrobacterium mixture was infiltrated at six points into a young leaf of N. tabacum, and transient expression was assayed 3 days after inoculation.Firefly luciferase and renilla luciferase were assayed using the dual luciferase assay reagents (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Three days after inoculation, 2 cm leaf discs (six technical replicates from each plant) were removed and ground in 500 μl of passive lysis buffer (PLB), then 10 μl of a 1/100 dilution of this crude extract was assayed in 40 μl of luciferase assay buffer, and the chemiluminescence measured. Stop and GlowTM buffer (40 μl; Promega) was then added and a second chemiluminescence measurement taken. Absolute relative luminescence units (RLU) were measured in a Turner 20/20 luminometer (Turner BioSystems, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), with a 5 sec delay and 15 sec integrated measurement.Induction of anthocyanins by transient transformation of tobaccoNicotiana tabacum plants were grown as described above and maintained in the glasshouse for the duration of the experiment. Agrobacterium cultures were incubated as for the dual luciferase assay, and separate strains containing the MYB TF gene and the bHLH TF gene fused to the 35S promoter in the pART27 binary vector were mixed (500 μl each) and infiltrated into the abaxial leaf surface as for the luciferase assay. Six separate infiltrations were performed into N. tabacum leaves (two plants per treatment) and changes in colour were measured daily using a Minolta CR-300 chromometer (calibrated to D65 light) (Konica Minolta, Mahwah, NJ, USA) by the L*a*b* system (CIE, 1986). Infiltrations comprising MdMYB10 together with an apple bHLH resulted in visible pigmentation after 4 days. The level of pigmentation increased throughout the experimental period; digital photographs and microscope images were taken 8 days after infiltration. To control for leaf-to-leaf variability, at least two leaves were infiltrated, and each leaf included positive controls (Agrobacterium cultures carrying MdMYB10 + MdbHLH3) and negative controls (Agrobacterium with empty vector).PhylogenyApple EST sequences were trimmed of vector, adapter and low-quality sequence regions and uploaded to Vector NTI version 9.0.0 (http://www.invitrogen.com). Full-length sequences were aligned using Vector NTI Clustal W (opening = 15, extension = 0.3). Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 3.1 (Kumar et al., 2004) using a minimum evolution phylogeny test and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Full MSF format files are available (Figure S6).Identification and quantification of anthocyaninsTobacco or apple samples were freeze-dried and coarsely ground before resuspension in 5 ml methanol and 0.1% HCl, extraction at room temperature for 2 h, and centrifugation at 3000 g. Aliquots of 1 ml were dried down to completion in a Labconco Centrivap Concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA). Samples were resuspended in 20% methanol (250 μl). Anthocyanins were identified by LC-MS analysis as described previously (Montefiori et al., 2005). Identification was based on both masses (M+) of molecular ions and characteristic fragments, and comparison of retention times and fragmentation with authentic standards of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-galactoside. Anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds were quantified by HPLC as described previously (Stevenson et al., 2006). Quantification was achieved by reference to standards of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds, using LC-MS data to confirm identification of peaks.Transformation of appleThe binary vector pSAK277-MdMYB10 (Figure S5) containing the MdMYB10 cDNA driven by the 35S promoter was transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by the freeze–thaw method. Transgenic Malus domestica‘Royal Gala’ plants were generated by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of leaf pieces, using a method previously reported (Yao et al., 1995).Go to:Supplementary MaterialThe following supplementary material is available for this article online:Figure S1Expression data for DFR family members.Click here to view.(283K, doc)Figure S2TF expression data in transgenic apple.Figure S3pGreen II 0800-LUC vector map.Click here to view.(283K, doc)Figure S4pGreen II 62 SK binary vector map.Click here to view.(283K, doc)Figure S5pSak 277 MDMYBIO binary vector map.Click here to view.(283K, doc)Figure S6Protein sequence alignments.Click here to view.(283K, doc)Table S1Primers for qPCRClick here to view.(283K, doc)This material is available as part of the online article from http://www.blackwell-synergy.comGo to:AcknowledgmentsWe thank Kevin Davies (Crop and Food Research, Palmerston North, New Zealand) for helpful discussions and advice, and Bernd Weisshaar (Universitat Bielefeld, Bielefeld, Germany) for providing sequence information on the bHLH family.

Posted on August 22, 2019August 22, 2019 by applesRed Color Development in Apple Fruit 


A key quality attribute of apple fruit is its peel or skin color, which affects consumer preferences. Immature fruits are green, and as the fruit ripens the green may fade partially or completely, resulting in very pale cream to green background colors. Red cultivars result from a superimposed accumulation of the red pigment anthocyanin. Anthocyanin accumulation in apple fruit can be affected by environmental, nutritional, and orchard management factors, the stage of maturity of the fruit, and by the microenvironment within the canopy. Note in the photo above, the difference in color of Honeycrisp apples grown in Minnesota (lower bin) and Washington state (upper bin).  
Apple peel color is an important factor determining apple market acceptance. In general, red apples are preferred, particularly well- colored bright red types. Furthermore, consumer preferences vary from country to country and region to region. Studies have concluded that New Zealand consumers prefer striped apples; consumers from Nova Scotia, Canada, favor blushed apples; while consumers in British Columbia, Canada, were more accepting of a range of apple fruit colors.
Apple fruit peel color is one of the main traits people look at to differentiate among cultivars and thus should be considered when planting any cultivar, but particularly strains of cultivars with varying red pigmentation. For instance, Fireside, a striped cultivar, and Connell Red, a red-blushed sport of Fireside, do not deviate from their respective patterns within a tree or across the genotype even after many years of asexual propagation. In contrast to what is observed in these cultivars, fruit pigmentation in Honeycrisp apple can adopt two basic patterns: blushed or striped. Blushed fruits are defined as those that never show stripes, even in less colored areas of the peel. These two color patterns can appear together on the same tree, and even on the same spur, a very unusual phenomenon in apple.
Red color development varies with environmental conditions. Light and temperature are key factors. Anthocyanin production in apples is absolutely light dependent; not only the intensity but also the quality of light influences anthocyanin formation. Low temperatures increase and high temperatures reduce anthocyanin concentration in apple peels. For instance, Honeycrisp grown in the cooler, northern climes develops a cherry-red blush or stripes. As this cultivar is grown in warmer, southern environments, red color development is reduced.
How to improve red color development in red-fruited cultivars?  Some production methods that can be used include:
·         Bagging individual fruits (Saure, 1990)
·         Plastic films under trees for light reflection (Funke and Blanke, 2005)
·         Fruit thinning (Delong et al., 2006)
·         Pruning to improve light penetration into the canopy (Saure, 1990)

That's not a fair question, cuz there are so many different types of apples even within colors.  I like golden delicious, but not granny smith.  I like McIntosh, but not red delicious.

I wanted to make a poll with different types of apples but way too many for a poll 


This is more for a sweet, sour or tart taste

Texture is what counts, followed by flavor. I'd rather have a crisp,bland apple than a mealy sweet one. best of all is crisp and slightly tart, like Granny Smith, though sweet Galas are good, too. Color is for identification only, otherwise meaningless except in fruit salad, where one likes a variety.

I'm the opposite, I'd rather eat a mealy, shrivelled up one as long as it's sweet than a bland or sour crispy one.

Love a good Granny Smith, but Honey Crisps are also good. Depends on my mood. The main thing is it has to be crunchy. Same goes for peaches. You will never catch me biting into a soft peach.

Promoting Red Color in Apples

August 18, 2020August 18, 2020 |  By Amaya Atucha




Color development in apples is a complex process because many factors are involved: genetics, environmental conditions (i.e., light and temperature), nutrition, stress, crop load, etc. Probably some of the most common causes for low red color development in apple orchards are excessive crop load, shaded canopies, and warm fall temperatures. Unfortunately, there isn’t much that we can do to control temperature in the orchards, and if the warm weather trends that we have experienced these weeks in August continue through September (it looks like we will have a warmer than normal September), there might be a delayed in color development.
At this point in the growing season there are a couple of managements that can be implemented to promote red color development. One of them is to use reflective mulches/films under the tree canopy. We recommend placing them about 3-4 weeks before harvest, and if you have narrow trees placing them just on the west side of the row. The other alternative to increase color development is to use plant growth regulators. There are two products that have shown good results in several research trials, Ethephon and Blush.
Ethephon (2 pint/ac) can improve color development when applied 1 week before harvest. Ethephon will stimulate fruit ripening so if applied more than 1 week before harvesting it will increase fruit drop, so be careful! If you are concerned about excessive fruit drop, you can combine ethephon with a preharvest drop product such as Fruitone. Blush, that contains jasmonates, has shown to moderately increase red color development without affecting fruit ripening or increasing early drop. Blush can be applied 2 to 4 weeks before harvest, but best results have been obtained when applied twice, at 3 and 1 weeks before harvest.

Anthocyanins are phytochemicals that provide some of the reds and purples found in flowers, wine, and fruit. The anthocyanins benefit the plant by attracting pollinators and benefit humans by acting as antioxidants in our diet (Khoo et al., 2017). The level of anthocyanins that accumulate in a plant depends on the environmental conditions. For example, light exposure influences anthocyanins to accumulate rapidly in apples (Malus domestica cv. “Red Fuji”), prompting a color change. However, the molecular mechanism that causes light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples remains unclear. In this issue, Huaying Ma, Tuo Yang, and colleagues (Ma et al. 2021) discovered a transcriptional cascade that regulates early stage, light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples.Previous studies have demonstrated that ethylene response factors (ERFs) are a class of transcription factors (TFs) that play a role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis (An et al., 2020). The authors used their previously published transcriptome database (Yang et al., 2019) to identify apple ERFs that were expressed 3 days after light treatment. One of these apple ERFs, MdERF109, was induced during the early stages of light treatment. Combining this result with high-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that anthocyanin accumulation strongly correlated with MdERF109 transcript levels. The authors hypothesized that MdERF109 functions in coloration by binding to the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Yeast-one-hybrid assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and transactivation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that MdERF109 binds and transcriptionally activates the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The strength of this paper was demonstrating their results consistently in planta, as transgenic manipulation of MdERF109 in apple calli and fruit showed that MdERF109 is sufficient to regulate anthocyanin content.Genes that are regulated by light tend to have light-responsive elements in their promoter sequence. However, Ma and colleagues were unable to find light-responsive elements in the MdERF109 promoter. Given that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) located upstream of target genes can induce expression of those genes via cis-acting modules, and that some lncRNAs are light-regulated, the authors hypothesized that an lncRNA might be responsible for regulating MdERF109 gene expression. After screening for the cis-pattern in an lncRNA sequencing database, the authors identified an apple lncRNA, MdLNC499, located ∼15kb from MdERF109. Using a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture analysis, a tool used to examine chromosomal spatial relationships between genes, the authors identified a region with strong cross-linking signal, suggesting that MdLNC499 has a cis-regulatory role in MdERF109 expression. Functional assays that overexpressed or silenced MdLNC499 in apple fruit and calli demonstrated that both anthocyanin accumulation and MdERF109 transcript levels are dependent on MdLNC499. These results suggest that MdLNC499 positively regulates MdERF109 expression to promote light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis.After discovering that MdLNC499 regulates MdERF109, the authors explored the sequence of MdLNC499 to determine if it contained any known cis-elements. W-box elements, required for WRKY TF binding, were indeed present in the MdLNC499 promoter, suggesting that this lncRNA is regulated by a WRKY TF. A follow-up RT-qPCR analysis showed that MdWRKY1 was induced following light treatment in apple. Biochemical and transactivation experiments demonstrated that MdWRKY1 can bind to the promoter of MdLNC499 and transcriptionally regulate it. These results were consistent in their functional assays in apple fruit and calli as MdWRKY1 positively regulated MdLNC499 and anthocyanin accumulation. Finally, by transiently silencing the expression of MdERF109, MdLNC499, and MdWRKY1 in the corresponding overexpressing transgenic calli, the authors were able to construct a MdWRKY1-MdLNC499-MdERF109 transcriptional cascade that regulates light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple (see Figure).Open in a separate windowFigureProposed model for how light promotes anthocyanin accumulation in apple fruit through the MdWRKY1-MdLNC499-MdERF109 transcriptional cascade. Light induces MdWRKY1 to activate the expression of MdLNC499 via a W-box in the promoter. MdLNC499 then promotes the expression of MdERF109, which subsequently targets the expression of downstream anthocyanin-related genes, promoting a change in coloration in apple. Reproduced from Ma et al. (2021), Figure 10.Revealing a mechanism of light-induced coloration presents possibilities of engineering this pathway to shorten or lengthen the time for a fruit to ripen. This is something that may prove to be critical with our world’s changing climate. So the next time you’re eating an apple and admiring its colors, you can also admire the transcriptional cascade involved in this process.Go to:References

                        Improving Apple Coloration
                    















Improving Apple Coloration










                                Color of the skin is a very appealing apple quality to consumers. Therefore, growers generally seek to improve fruit coloration. Crop nutrition can help to achieve the desired appearance.

                            



Crop Nutrition and Apple Coloration
Over-use or late applications of nitrogen reduces the red coloration of red apples. Foliar application of a fertilizer containing phosphorus, calcium and magnesium, has been shown to enhance red peel color, and an increase in the concentration of flavonoids in ‘Fuji’ apples.
Nitrogen


Over-use or late applications of nitrogen reduces the red coloration of red apples. This can be advantageous in green apples, as it will improve greenness and minimize red colors.




Phosphorus
Trials in South Africa show that phosphorus has a positive effect in fruit coloration. It does so by increasing the production of an enzyme involved in the production of anthocyanin, one of the main compounds in fruit that determines its red color. Phosphorus source and timing are important. Foliar phosphate is very effective after flowering and at early ripening where there is a need to improve fruit coloration.



Paliyath et al. (2002) studied the effect of soil and foliar phosphorus supplementation on the post-harvest quality of apples (Malus domestica Borkh. cv. ‘McIntosh’ and cv. ‘Red Delicious’) and found that phosphorus fertilization increased the percentage of red skin on both varieties at harvest. They have also found that fruit from sprayed sides of the trees subjected to foliar treatments with phosphorus and magnesium or phosphorus and calcium, from blossom until a week before commercial harvest, had increased red color compared to those from the non-sprayed side.
Potassium

Potassium also increases anthocyanin content in apples, which improves the fruit coloration. However, supplies need to be in balance with other cations, particularly calcium, as preferential uptake of potassium over calcium can lead to quality problems such as bitter pit.


Magnesium
Soil applied magnesium improves the color of red fruit largely through the increased production of carbohydrates, which are the building block for red pigments.


Zinc and Manganese
Zinc helps improve apple color, while manganese helps improve background, green color in apples.

Managing Sugar/Acid Ratio in Apples


                Apple flavor and taste are related to the level of soluble solids in the fruit, which are mainly sugars. Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is therefore of extreme importance to measure the quality of apple. 
            







Reducing Bitter Pit Incidence in Apples


                Bitter pit is a physiological disorder associated with low levels of calcium in the apple tissue, which reduces apple quality and marketability.

That's not a fair question, cuz there are so many different types of apples even within colors.  I like golden delicious, but not granny smith.  I like McIntosh, but not red delicious.

Texture is what counts, followed by flavor. I'd rather have a crisp,bland apple than a mealy sweet one. best of all is crisp and slightly tart, like Granny Smith, though sweet Galas are good, too. Color is for identification only, otherwise meaningless except in fruit salad, where one likes a variety.

I'm the opposite, I'd rather eat a mealy, shrivelled up one as long as it's sweet than a bland or sour crispy one.

Love a good Granny Smith, but Honey Crisps are also good. Depends on my mood. The main thing is it has to be crunchy. Same goes for peaches. You will never catch me biting into a soft peach.

In fact, it has a major influence on consumer choice. Skin color is, thus, one of the most important criteria taken into account by breeders. For apples, most novel varieties are so-called “mutants” or “sports” that have been identified in clonal populations. Indeed, many “sports” exist that show distinct phenotypic differences compared to the varieties from which they originated. These differences affect a limited number of traits of economic importance, including skin color. Until recently, the detailed genetic or epigenetic changes resulting in heritable phenotypic changes in sports was largely unknown. Recent technological advances and the availability of several high-quality apple genomes now provide the bases to understand the exact nature of the underlying molecular changes that are responsible for the observed phenotypic changes observed in sports. The present review investigates the molecular nature of sports affected in apple skin color giving arguments in favor of the genetic or epigenetic explanatory models.Keywords: epigenetics, genetics, skin color, apple, transposable element, transcriptome factorGo to:1. IntroductionApple skin color is one of the most important factors determining the acceptance and economic value of apples. The red coloration of the skin of an apple fruit is mainly attributed to anthocyanin pigmentation. Therefore, anthocyanin is key to improving our understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in this trait.In Europe, distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) testing of fruit species is long and expensive compared to other crop sectors [1]. This process aims to determine whether a new variety is different from an existing variety within the same species (“distinctness”). Furthermore, it is used to determine whether distinctive traits are expressed uniformly (“uniformity”), and whether subsequent processes will change the phenotype of the generation (“stability”). The DUS test exists to allow new varieties to enter the market legally and allow plant breeders to protect their rights. Apple varieties appear to come about as clearly distinctive mutants, but certain apple mutants, for example derived from the “Gala” variety, may only show subtle phenotypic changes and are difficult to distinguish from each other, thus requiring long and expensive tests. To better distinguish these varieties, it is necessary to decipher the genetic or epigenetic origin of the skin color mutations, then to develop molecular genetic or epigenetic markers to help institutions such as the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) to accelerate testing of fruit species.Recently, numerous studies have investigated the roles of genetics and epigenetics in apple skin color development. The aim of this review is to bring together the findings of these articles and summarize the genetic and epigenetic regulation of apple skin color. This review gives arguments in favor of the genetic and epigenetic explanatory models and gives an overview of the research frontier.Go to:2. Anthocyanin Biosynthesis and Pigment CompositionApple skin color is determined by the contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, as well as their distribution over the skin surface. Anthocyanin content plays an important role in the degree of coloring of red apples. The content and distribution patterns of anthocyanins in the skin are responsible for the different color phenotypes. With the same anthocyanin content, a higher chlorophyll content will make the skin color dark red, whereas a lower content will cause the skin color to be bright red [2,3].Anthocyanins are water-soluble flavonoids occurring naturally in plants and are widely distributed. Furthermore, anthocyanins are important in plants as secondary metabolites. So far, twenty-two major types of anthocyanins have been described in more than 250 species [4]. At present, five anthocyanin components have been studied extensively in the skin of apples: cyanidin-3-arabinoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-galactosides, cyanidin-3-xylosides, and cyanidin-3-glucosides [5]. Among these anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-galactoside was found to be the most abundant in apple skin, accounting for about 80% of the total anthocyanin content [4].Anthocyanins play numerous roles in plants, most importantly in the reproductive organs. For example, anthocyanins can make flowers appear to be brightly colored to facilitate plant pollination [6]. In addition, anthocyanins can protect plants from low temperatures and other abiotic and biotic stresses [7]. Indeed, when plants are in a stressful environment, the accumulation of anthocyanins can have a protective role [8]. A well-known example is the reddening of the leaves of deciduous trees in autumn, induced by lower temperatures, to protect the plant from freezing damage [9]. In addition, studies have shown that anthocyanins can play an antioxidant role in plants; however, the proportion of anthocyanins with an antioxidant function in apples is only about 1–20% [10]. Anthocyanins are also an important indicator for evaluating fruit maturity. Generally, the content of anthocyanins will be relatively high when the fruit is mature.To study fruit color, we first need to inspect the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. This pathway has already been studied in detail—it starts with the biosynthesis of phenylalanine with the help of different enzymes and transcription factors (TFs) [11] (Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Diagrammatic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in apples, according to Takos et al. [14]. PAL, Phe ammonia lyase; CHS, Chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone-3 b-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase. UFGT, UDP-glycose: flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase; FLS, flavonol synthase; GT, glycosyl transferase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase.The biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments is influenced by two categories of genes. To the first category belong structural genes encoding enzymes, such as chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), and UDP-glucose: flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT). The second category comprises genes coding for regulatory proteins, which include a number of TFs that influence the intensity and pattern of anthocyanin accumulation. At least three protein families, namely MYB, bHLH, and WD40, are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis, but the specific classes and the genes involved in the biosynthesis vary depending on the species [12,13].Anthocyanins can accumulate in leaves, roots, and stocks [15], while regulatory proteins which involve in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway are localized in the cytosol. After biosynthesis, flavonoids are transported to vacuoles or cell walls [16]. Anthocyanins are upregulated by maturity and the formation of flavonoids, especially anthocyanin and chlorogenic acid in apple skin, which influence growth regulators and fruit maturity [17]. The signals or metabolite biosynthesis which influence the maturity of fruits also influence anthocyanin accumulation. For example, plant hormones (abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonates, auxin, gibberellin) have a crucial role in the regulation of fruit development and ripening. They interact with MYB–bHLH–WD40 complexes at either the transcriptional or the post-transcriptional level to control the anthocyanin composite [18]. Espley et al. [15] reported that the increased flux in the anthocyanin pathway was also associated with increases in metabolite concentrations of other polyphenols, including up to a 10-fold increase in quercetin-3-galactoside. Anthocyanins in the vacuole are degraded by peroxidases. The possible involvement of vacuolar peroxidases in anthocyanin degradation may be a component of the adaptation of plants to changing environmental conditions, such as decreased light intensities, but may also be a component of the plant developmental program [19].Rootstocks also link with apple skin color. From the 20th century, much research has been conducted on the subject. In a study using seven rootstocks, Rogers [20] observed the best color on fruit from “Bramley” trees grafted on “M9”. Tukey and Brase [21] and Blair [22] observed that red-colored cultivars developed higher color on “M”. Hewetson [23] and Upshall [24] found that the increase in red fruit color intensity found on some Malling rootstocks was due to earlier maturity date [25]. The amount of total phenolic compounds and flavonoids increased, which may be due to the influence of different rootstocks and the incompatibility between the rootstock and the scion or grafting wound. In one study, “Bud 9” rootstock generally had a negative effect on the amount of anthocyanin, while M9 increased the amount of anthocyanin [26]. Grafting of “Bekran” on “Bekran” rootstock and “Red Delicious” cultivar on “Bekran” decreased the anthocyanin in scion leaves, but when “Bastam” cultivar was grafted on this rootstock it increased the amount of anthocyanin [26].Go to:3. Genetic Determinants of Apple Skin Color3.1. MYB Transcription Factors Regulate Apple Skin ColorThe genetic mechanisms determining skin color in apple have been investigated in a number of studies [14,27,28]. MYB TFs have been reported to play an important role in plant secondary metabolism, especially the phenylalanine metabolism pathway. In particular, the well-studied MdMYB1, MdMYBA, and MdMYB10 genes code for TFs that were found to control the color of apple skin and flesh [14,27,28].MdMYB1 (Md: Malus × domestica) is a TF isolated and identified from apples that regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple skins. The transcriptional abundance of this gene was strongly regulated by light and positively correlated with anthocyanin accumulation [14]. Another study confirmed that light can make the MdMYB1 protein more stable, and therefore can enhance the anthocyanin synthesis of apple skin [29]. A further finding was that the promoter region of MdMYB1 is rich in polymorphisms [14]. Based on these polymorphisms, a set of dCAPS markers was designed based on MdMYB1-1, which had a dominant effect on fruit skin color [14]. Apples that have MdMYB1-1 will exhibit a red-skinned phenotype, whereas those that do not have the MdMYB1-1 allele will have yellow or green skin [14]. However, this MdMYB1 dCAPS marker was unable to identify alleles of the MdMYB1 gene in “Fuji” apples [30].In addition to MdMYB1, MdMYB10 and MdMYBA were isolated and found to be closely associated with the redness of apple skin and flesh [27,28]. Low temperature and UV-B (280 ~ 320nm) induced MdMYBA in different tissues. There were significant differences in expression levels between differently colored varieties [27]. Confirming its direct role in anthocyanin biosynthesis, it was shown that MdMYB10 overexpression could significantly enhance anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic apple seedlings [28].In recent research, the anthocyanin biosynthesis process has been proven to be more complex, with more genes, TFs, and interactions having been discovered. A number of other MYB TFs were found in the apple genome (Figure 2). Among them, MdMYB3 is involved in the transcriptional activation of several flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes [31]. In addition, it not only regulates anthocyanin accumulation in the apple skin, but also participates in the regulation of flower development [31]. Recently, another MYB TF, MdMYB16, was described, which could form homodimers and directly inhibit anthocyanin synthesis through its C-terminal EAR (ethylene responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression) repressor [32]. MdMYB16 was shown to interact with a bHLH family TF MdbHLH33 to weaken inhibition of anthocyanin synthesis [32]. More recently, a light-responsive MYB-like gene called MdMYBDL1 was found [33]. It functions downstream of MdHY5, which coordinates light signal transduction and regulates the expression of flower color [33]. MdHY5 activates the expression of MdMYBDL1, while MdMYBDL1 inhibited the transcription of MdMYB16 and its homolog MdMYB308, which are inhibitors of anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples. This means that MdHY5 is able to promote anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples (Figure 2) [32]. These results indicate that MdHY5 enhances apple anthocyanins synthesis by acting on different types of MYB TFs [33]. In addition, MdMYB9 and MdMYB11 were found to bind to the promoters of structural genes, such as a bHLH TF MdbHLH3 and WD repeat protein TTG1 to regulate anthocyanin and PA accumulation [34]. Moreover, two putative flavonoid-related genes, MdMYB12 (proanthocyanidin-specific TF) and MdMYB22 (flavonol-specific TF), were found to directly facilitate the expression of leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and flavonol synthase (FLS), respectively [35]. MdMYB12 is thought to interact with bHLH3 and bHLH33, which are regulators of anthocyanin synthesis in apples [28], and to facilitate the expression of LAR and promote proanthocyanidin synthesis. Furthermore, MdMYB22 activates flavonol pathways by directly combining with the flavonol synthase (FLS) promoter [35]. Among the MYB TFs, MdMYB111 was found to bind the MYB recognition element (MRE) of the MdANS (anthocyanidin synthase) promoter and to potentially inhibit anthocyanin biosynthesis [36]. MdWRKY40 was found to form homodimers and to bind to the W box of the MdANS promoter. In addition, it was shown to reduce the inhibitory effect of MdMYB111 on anthocyanin biosynthesis. This means that both MdMYB111 and MdWRKY40 are important regulatory elements of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (Figure 2) [36].Open in a separate windowFigure 2Diagrammatic representation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and the related TFs in apples. Green arrows indicate TFs activating enzymes in the pathway, while orange barred lines signify a TF inhibiting enzyme expression in the pathway.In addition to MYBs, other TFs are involved in regulating anthocyanin synthesis and transport. Anthocyanins are biosynthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and are then transported into the vacuole for storage [37]. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are thought to be responsible for the transport of anthocyanins into the vacuole in apples [38]. MdGSTF6 encodes an important GST transporter of anthocyanins in apple fruit and its expression is activated by MdMYB1, providing evidence for the related regulatory mechanisms [39]. Therefore, MdMYB1 is thought to not only regulate anthocyanin synthesis, but also to control anthocyanin transport in apples [39]. A nitrate-induced LBD (lateral organ boundaries domain) TF gene, MdLBD13, has been discovered, which can repress anthocyanin biosynthesis by downregulating the expression of genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis, such as MdMYB1, MdMYB9/11, and MdbHLH3/33, resulting in reduced anthocyanin accumulation [40]. MdLBD13 could, thus, play the role of a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis [40].In conclusion, MYB TFs, especially those encoded by MdMYB1, MdMYBA, and MdMYB10 genes, play important roles in the regulation of apple skin color [14,27,28]. However, a number of other MYB family genes also control the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, such as the aforementioned MdMYB3, MdMYB9, MdMYB11, MdMYB12, MdMYB16, MdMYB22, MdMYBDL1, MdMYB111, and MdMYB308. Their effects in the anthocyanin pathway are shown in Figure 2.3.2. Genetic MappingSince the 1990s, numerous quantitative genetics studies on apples have allowed the location of a huge number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and major genes linked to the major agronomical traits. Amongst these, only a few were concerned with polyphenol compounds [41,42,43]. A small number of genetic studies have been performed to decipher red pigmentation in apple. Since apple skin color is one of the main factors defining the commercial value of apples, several genetic studies have been performed to decipher its locations in the genetic maps of apples. These studies have been performed thanks to the availability of different kinds of molecular markers, such as single sequence repeats (SSRs) [44]. However, the bulk of the studies used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [41,45,46,47], which are the most abundant type of DNA sequence polymorphisms [48]. These were based on different origins and kinds of plant materials, such as segregating populations [41,45,46,49] and cultivar populations, through genome wide analysis studies (GWAS). The results of all these studies are convergent, showing that MdMYB10 and MdMYB1 are the two main transcription factors involved in the regulation of red skin color in apples [44]. As MdMYB1 and MdMYBA share identical sequences and MdMYB10 and MdMYB1 genes are located at very similar positions, sharing 98% homology on linkage group 9, it was concluded that these genes were allelic [27,28,50,51]. In addition, MYB TFs also influence red-flesh apples, of which there are normally two types. In type 1, red pigmentation is observed from the fruit set through to maturity, exhibiting red fruit skin, leaves, stems, roots, and flowers. In type 2, red pigmentation is only present in the fruit cortex at the late stage of fruit development and the leaves are green [52,53]. Differences in anthocyanin accumulation in the red flesh type 2 apples have been associated with one SNP marker close to the MdMYB10 homolog MdMYB110a, which is physically located on LG 17 [52].The last genetic mapping results identified alleles of SSRs and SNPs markers that could be used in molecular assisted breeding [42,44,45,47]. However, these studies cannot assist in the distinction of apple mutants (e.g., Gala), which show very tiny differences in skin coloration. For this, new approaches need to be developed.3.3. Copy Number VariationsCopy number variations (CNVs) are defined as deletions, duplications, or insertions of DNA sequence fragments longer than 50 base pairs in length [54]. CNVs have the potential to influence genes by altering their structure and expression [55]. CNVs are a common feature of plant genomes that include non-global duplication and deletion events [55].Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have greatly facilitated the discovery of CNVs [56]. Using NGS data, copy number variable regions (CNVRs) within the apple genome were detected, as well as examined for their distribution and impact [55]. In total, 876 CNVRs accounting for 3.5% of the apple genome were identified. The enrichment of the CNVRs with gene loci of agronomical significance has drawn attention to these newly discovered forms of genetic variation in apples [55].Notably, some MYB TFs were found to have CNVs that could be linked to apple fruit coloration. For instance, a rearrangement in the upstream regulatory region of the gene encoding the MdMYB10 was detected [57]. This rearrangement includes a series of multiple repeats, forming a microsatellite-like structure, featuring five direct tandem repeats of a 23 bp sequence. This MdMYB10 rearrangement was only present in red-fleshed apple varieties and was not observed in white-fleshed varieties. Transient analysis showed that the 23 bp sequence motif is a target for the MdMYB10 protein itself, and the number of repeat units is related to the increase in transactivation by MdMYB10 [57]. The red-fleshed phenotype is also associated with enhanced expression of MdMYB110a (paralog of MdMYB10) [52]. Functional characterization of MYB110a showed that it could upregulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). MdMYB10 (LG 9) and MdMYB110a (LG 17) have conserved functions in some varieties, but their expression and response to fruit maturity are different. MdMYB10 was found to be expressed in apple skin, flesh, and foliage, while MdMYB110a was found to only be expressed in the fruit cortex [52]. Other anthocyanin-related MYBs were selected from a number of plant species, including apple, pear, strawberry, petunia, kiwifruit, and Arabidopsis thaliana, to initiate promoters containing the R6 motif, which has six minisatellite repeat units thought to increase anthocyanin pigmentation [58]. Insertion of the apple R6 motif into the MYB10 orthologous promoter of pear (PcMYB10) and Arabidopsis (AtMY75) was able to increase anthocyanin levels [58].In conclusion, copy number differences could be used as markers for apple color, especially MdMYB10 and MdMYB110a (summarized in Table 1).Table 1Overview of CNVs for apple color characteristics.Related GeneCNV Length LGReference

Transposable ElementsTransposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous mobile genetic factors that can make up more than 50% of a plant’s nuclear genome [59]. They can be divided into two broad classes according to their method of proliferation [60,61]. Class I elements transpose by reverse transcription of RNA intermediates, and once inserted into a new location in the genome they cannot be removed [60,61]. This class includes retrotransposons and potential retroviruses with long terminal repeats (LTR), as well as non-LTR elements, including long and short interspersed nuclear elements (LINE and SINE, respectively) and processed pseudogenes [60,61]. Class II elements (also called DNA transposons) can be excised and inserted, and thus move from one nuclear position to another [60,61]. Some coding factors mediate their own transposition, while others are non-autonomous, depending on the activity of the transposase encoded at a separate site [60,61,62].TEs are usually methylated via small RNAs, and this methylation can extend to surrounding genes, making them inactive [63,64]. The role played by retrotransposons in plant genomes is well known—by self-replication and insertion into multiple genomic sites [65,66], they have an influence on the size, structure, function, and evolution of plant genomes. Retrotransposons, thus, are an important source of genetic diversity; they may cause changes that could lead to genetic variations within plant species [66,67].TEs account for 60% of the apple genome in the final assembly and provide insights into its evolution [68]. LTR retrotransposons (LRNs) are the most abundant type of TEs [69,70]. There is evidence that TEs affect the appearance of some genetic variation in the color of pome fruits [71]. Recently, a gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon (denoted as redTE) was found inserted in the upstream of the MdMYB1 promoter and could be associated with red coloration [72]. The redTE controlled the development of red coloration by lowering the threshold of light response. This insertion appears in the HFTH1 (“Hanfu”, which has bright red skin color) genome and is located −3297 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon of MdMYB1 [72]. This redTE has two target site duplications (TSDs) and two identical flanking LTR sequences (1274 bp). Furthermore, redTE-mediated control of anthocyanin distribution patterns manipulates MdMYB1 function through the creation of genetic and epigenetic alleles under natural conditions [72].It is noteworthy that TEs were found to be associated with coloration in other fruit species. For example, in blood oranges, two different TE inserts are responsible for the cold-induced Ruby expression, thereby regulating fruit color [73]. In grapes, a Gypsy-like retrotransposon called Gret1 inhibited the expression of MYBA1, while the retrotransposon is linked with the development of white-skinned berries [74,75]. The recombination between Gret1 LTRs caused some restoration of MYB gene function and blush-skinned sports, including “Flame Muscat” and “Chardonnay Rose” [73,76]. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether similar redTE insertions could enhance MYB transcription in other Rosaceae fruit species [72,73]. These findings strongly suggest that TE insertions may also play key roles in influencing traits of interest in apples.In conclusion, redTE-mediated control of the distribution patterns of anthocyanin accumulation is exerted through the creation of genetic and epigenetic alleles that manipulate the function of MdMYB1 under natural conditions. This suggests that some TEs and retrotransposon elements are linked with the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in apple skin. Therefore, we will next look at the epigenetic determinants of apple skin color.Go to:4. Epigenetic Determinants of Apple Skin ColorIn addition to genetic factors, some epigenetic factors can also affect apple skin color. Epigenetics describe mitotically or meiotically heritable variations in gene expression that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence [77,78,79]. Thus, epigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in gene transcription that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic marks can be transferred from one generation to the next [79,80]. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is achieved through DNA methylation and specific histone modifications [79,81].4.1. DNA Methylation and DemethylationDNA methylation can be highly stable and inherited in a mendelian manner. This was demonstrated by experiments with 30 consecutive generations of plants in Arabidopsis thaliana [79,82]. In plants, DNA methylation has three sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, T, or C) [83]. One of the key activities of DNA methylation is the silencing of TFs to prevent their transcription and mobility.Emerging evidence suggests that a modification in DNA methylation is also important for the ripening of fleshy fruits [84]. In tomatoes, the VTE3 gene regulates the vitamin E content in fruits. VTE3 expression is linked with the TE methylation level in the promoter region [85]. In sweet oranges, a DNA methylation inhibitor, by stopping further increase in DNA methylation, could prevent fruit from degreening [86]. Some studies have investigated the role of epigenetics in apples, comparing specific varieties and their mutants that produce fruit with a stable pigment pattern or different skin phenotypes, respectively. For example, mutants of “Honeycrisp” or “Fuji” can produce fruit with two different kinds of patterns,—striped and blushed. In “Honeycrisp”, DNA methylation at the MdMYB10 promoter was detected’ increased DNA methylation levels were observed in green stripes, and a 900 bp long sequence, starting 1400 bp upstream of the translation start site, was highly methylated in MdMYB10 [71]. Another example concerns varieties derived from “Gala”, with “Kidd’s D-8” (KID) being the red-skinned mutant and “Blondee” (BLO) being the yellow-skinned mutant [38]. Two regions, MR3 and MR7, exist in the MdMYB10 promotor that showed significant differences between BLO and KID. Methylation was found to be higher and gradually increased during fruit development of BLO, whereas in KID it was lower and constant. The higher levels of DNA methylation reduced MdMYB10 transcription, and thus anthocyanin production [38]. In “Hanfu”, DNA was also methylated in the MR3 and MR7 regions in MdMYB1; in the MR8-MR11 regions, the degree of methylation of redTE was high. This suggests that redTE-induced epigenetic changes may be related to variable color patterns [72].DNA methylation could modify both regulatory and structural genes in the anthocyanin pathway. In apple skin, differential changes in methylation patterns related to anthocyanin concentrations have been reported [87]. Two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were linked to the anthocyanin pathway: MdANS and MdF3H. These genes were up regulated in apple mutants, and differences in the methylation patterns of their promoters were observed [87]. The transcription of structural genes may be regulated by both changes in TF levels and DNA methylation. Additionally, the expression of the TF MdMYB114 was upregulated in deep-skinned apples [87]. In “Fuji”, the methylation in three ‘mutants with different colors was detected, and it was found that the CHH methylation level in the MR3 region (–1246 to –780) of the MdMYB1 promoter was negatively correlated with MdMYB1 expression [88]. MdAGO4, which plays a key role in RNA-directed DNA methylation, is required for CHH methylation, which was found to interact with the MdMYB1 promoter. The promoter of MdMYB1 was found to be methylated through binding of MdAGO4 to this gene’s promoter, thereby regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis [88].Methylation of cytosine in the genome of eukaryotes is often related to repeats, including TEs and their derivatives. Such sequences are usually enriched in centromeres and their vicinity [79]. It was confirmed that the differential accumulation of MdMYB1-specific mRNA was causing the difference in anthocyanin levels between “Granny Smith” and “Golden Delicious” [89]. The methylation level of the promoter region was linked to different levels of MdMYB1 transcripts in the two varieties. The formation of red pigment in the skin of “Granny Smith” is related to the hypomethylation of the MdMYB1 promoter [89].Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is a useful method of detection for methylation differences between different color mutants. Using this method, Li et al. [90] found the methylation relationship between Red Delicious (G0) and its four-generation bud sport mutants (G1 to G4) [90]. The phenotypes of the mutants were different and the pigmentation in the apple skin gradually increased from G0 to G4 [91]. The phenotype of these mutants in Red Delicious was obviously linked with the difference in DNA methylation [90]. Furthermore, in some flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes (including CHS, PAL, F3’H, PER, 4CL, CYP98A, and CCoAOMT), the mCHG and mCG contexts are hypomethylated; the mCHG contexts upstream of MdMYB10 especially cause the transcriptional activation and increase anthocyanin accumulation. However, the methylation of the mCG context upstream of bHLH74 causes transcriptional repression and inhibits the accumulation of anthocyanin [90]. In summary, methylation is linked with apple skin coloration and patterning. Furthermore, higher levels of DNA methylation reduced MdMYB10 expression, and thus anthocyanin production [88].In addition to accumulation of DNA methylation having an influence on the anthocyanin pathway, demethylation is also linked to its regulation. Bagging treatment could induce epigenetic changes. Ma et al. [89] compared DNA methylation levels in the 2 kb upstream region of MdMYB1 in bag-treated apples after removal of the bags and unbagged controls. There was a correlation between hypomethylation and the red-skinned phenotype in “Granny Smith” apples [89]. Granny Smith fruits responded to treatment with an inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), an analog of cytosine that can inhibit the activity of DNA methyltransferases. These drug treatments effectively limited DNA methylation and induced color phenotype variants [92,93]. In Granny Smith, after bag removal and 5-aza-dC treatments, some MdMYB1 promoter regions showed reduced DNA methylation. This could indicate a 5-aza-dC-treatment-induced activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Granny Smith skin [89]. Ma et al. [94] performed another study in the same year to compare the transcriptomes of Granny Smith skin with and without 5-aza-dC treatment after bagging [94]. They found many differentially expressed genes through 5-aza-dC-treated and non-treated apples, including TF genes and anthocyanin accumulation-related genes. Demethylation treatments were linked to differential gene expression, while the regulatory mechanisms were associated with red pigmentation in “Granny Smith” apples and other non-red apple fruits [94]. Demethylation also enhanced the expression of MdMYB1-2 and MdMYB1-3 and induced the accumulation of anthocyanin in “Mutsu”, which was obtained from a yellow-skinned cultivar [95]. Some cases of demethylation were documented for Fuji mutants. Usually, Fuji fruit exhibit a striped pattern; however, “Beni Shogun”, one of its mutants, has blushed skin. The difference in methylation between Fuji and Beni Shogun was linked to reduced DNA methylation at MR7 in the MdMYB10 promoter, which increased full redness in the skin of these apples [96].From this part, we can conclude that both gain and loss of DNA methylation can influence the anthocyanin pathway (Table 2). Furthermore, DNA methylation might inhibit anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple skin, while demethylation seems to induce it. However, epigenetic levels are different in different organizations and in different developmental stages in plants [97]. The methylation is inherited but is less stable which depending upon the environment [97]. For example, the chestnut methylation level decreases with the age of the tree [98]. Epialleles or epimutations can generate stable and heritable changes of fruit phenotypes [99]. However, in some situations epialleles could be less stable and the apple mutant skin color could revert to the original apple color; the reason causing this change is still unknown. These scientific questions still need to be researched in the future.Table 2Overview of methylation and demethylation in apple color characteristics.Related GeneOver (+) or under (−) MethylatedEffect on TranscriptionReference

Histone ModificationsIn recent years, there has been evidence suggesting that a conserved histone H2 variant, H2A.Z, and histone methylation are associated with the regulation of gene transcription in different organisms throughout the genome [100,101]. However, little is known about the roles of these two types of epigenetic regulation in the control of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The conserved histone H2 variant, H2A.Z, negatively controls the accumulation of anthocyanin in Arabidopsis [102]. H2A.Z and H3K4me3 have an antagonistic effect on the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, which highlights a role of chromatin in gene regulation and reflects the complexity of gene regulatory mechanisms [102].Bagging treatment could induce epigenetic changes and the histone levels could be different in different regions of transcribed genes. This treatment was able to turn the normally non-red apple variety “Mutsu” into a red one. Furthermore, the histone H3K4me3 was found to be higher in the 5′ upstream region of MdMYB1-2/-3, while H3k27me3 was lower [95]. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in the 5′ upstream region of MdMYB1-2/-3 were associated with the paper-bagging-induced red pigmentation. The modifications of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 could induce the expression of MdMYB1-2/-3 in some regions [95].An example for the link between histones and anthocyanin accumulation can be found in Arabidopsis. A HD-ZIP II TF HAT1 negatively regulates the accumulation of anthocyanin through post-translational regulation of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) protein complex [103]. MYB75 was found to form a transcriptional repressor complex with HAT1-TPL through the deacetylation of histone H3 at the target gene in Arabidopsis [103]. It was indicated that HAT1 inhibited the formation of MBW protein complexes and recruited TPL core inhibitors to epigenetically regulate the anthocyanin late biosynthesis genes (LBGs), thereby inhibiting the activity of MBW protein complexes, and thus anthocyanin accumulation [103]. In maize, the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) protein R interacts with the MYB TF C1 and R-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to form a C1-R-RIF1 complex [104]. This complex binds to the A1 promoter and activates A1 expression through increasing H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation levels in the promoter region [104].In conclusion, identifying the interaction between MBW protein complexes and epigenetic regulators remains challenging [103]. How the histones regulate structural genes or TFs in the anthocyanins biosynthetic pathway in apple skin is still a complex question and an interesting subject that needs to be studied by subsequent researchers.4.3. Small RNAsRecently, in various organisms, small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identified as key genetic and epigenetic regulators, being involved in histone methylation and DNA modification to regulate the abundance of coding or non-coding RNAs [105]. In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the main regulatory RNA species [105]. The former are mainly involved in post-transcriptional regulation, while the latter are linked with transcriptional regulation [105]. Many of these characteristic sRNAs are related to numerous biological programs, processes, and pathways in response to developmental cues, environmental stress, pathogen infection, and pest infestation [105].In apples, miR828 and miR858 regulate a large number of MYB genes through targeting the region encoding the conserved R3 domain of the MYB protein [106]. MiR828 triggered the targeting of MYB genes to produce secondary phasiRNAs (phased siRNAs), thereby enhancing its silencing effect. Most MYBs for miR828 are linked with primary and secondary metabolism related to anthocyanin production [106]. Among them, there are nine MYBs co-targeted by miR828 and miR858, which are involved in the regulation of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis [106]. Xia et al. [106] conducted an analysis of 81 MYBs—29 MYBs were identified as targets, most of which are mainly involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis [106]. In tomato, miR858 plays a negative role in anthocyanin biosynthesis—blocking miR858 can increase the accumulation of anthocyanin by regulating the expression of SlMYB7 and SlMYB4861 [107].The RdDM pathway could influence fruit coloration in different apple mutants. Jiang et al. [88] systematically studied the causes of coloring differences in different apple bud varieties and found that there was a significant negative correlation between the content of anthocyanin in the skin and the CHH methylation level of the TF MdMYB1 promoter. CHH methylation is primarily mediated by the RdDM pathway [88]. The RdDM pathway AGO protein MdAGO4-1/2 was found to interact with the apple MdMYB1 promoter. In the apple callus, overexpression of MdAGO4s and MdDRM2s can increase the CHH methylation level at the MdMYB1 promoter, thus affecting the accumulation of anthocyanins in apples [88]. In summary, apple MdAGO4s bind to ABS (AGO4 binding site) on the MdMYB1 promoter, recruit the DNA methyltransferase MdDRM2, and exert a DNA methylation function. On the other hand, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) mediate the methylation of MdAGO4 binding site, thereby modifying the MdMYB1 promoter, affecting its expression and regulating fruit color [88].lncRNA could also be linked to anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples [108]. During light-induced rapid anthocyanin accumulation, RNA-seq analysis of apple skin of the “Red Fuji” variety revealed 5297 putative lncRNAs [108]. Differential expression analysis further showed that lncRNAs involved in photosynthesis during light treatment were transcribed [108]. It was predicted that two differentially expressed lncRNAs, MLNC3.2 and MLNC4.6, are potential endogenous target mimics (eTMs) for miRNA156a, which can prevent cleavage of SPL2-like and SPL33 during light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis [108]. SPL (squamosa promoter-binding protein-like) interacts with MYB TFs and coordinates the biosynthesis of anthocyanins during the exposure of apple skin [108]. This research provides basic insights into the involvement of lncRNA in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways of apple fruits [108].In conclusion, small RNAs are now widely recognized as key genetic and epigenetic regulatory factors in various organisms and biosynthesis pathways, including that of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Small RNAs such as miR828 and miR858 seem to synergistically regulate a large number of MYB genes by directly targeting the region encoding the conserved R3 domain of the MYB protein.Go to:5. ConclusionsIn this review, we have summarized the recent research on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms affecting the buildup of apple skin color. Most studies have investigated the genetic part of fruit coloring, with a focus on the genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, such as the MdMYB1 gene, which is linked with apple skin color. However, evidence on the role of epigenetics in the development of fruit color and patterns is now mounting. A number of tasks remain to be performed in the future—this review has shown a surprisingly large variety of regulatory mechanisms involved in a host of different genetic and epigenetic factors underlying the expression of skin coloration in apple fruit. Although the number of studies dedicated to the topic is impressive, more work still needs to be performed to clarify the roles of certain factors, especially when mechanisms seem to be redundant or complementary. In addition, from a more practical point of view, breeding of certain apple varieties would benefit from the development of genetic and epigenetic markers. This would allow apple breeders to better and more reliably distinguish apple mutants, saving them time and money.Go to:AcknowledgmentsThanks are due to the members of thesis committee for helpful advice in writing this review: Andrea Patocchi, Charles-Eric Durel, David Rousseau, Mohamed Zouine, and Sylvain Guyot.

That's not a fair question, cuz there are so many different types of apples even within colors.  I like golden delicious, but not granny smith.  I like McIntosh, but not red delicious.

I wanted to make a poll with different types of apples but way too many for a poll 


This is more for a sweet, sour or tart taste

Texture is what counts, followed by flavor. I'd rather have a crisp,bland apple than a mealy sweet one. best of all is crisp and slightly tart, like Granny Smith, though sweet Galas are good, too. Color is for identification only, otherwise meaningless except in fruit salad, where one likes a variety.

I'm the opposite, I'd rather eat a mealy, shrivelled up one as long as it's sweet than a bland or sour crispy one.

Love a good Granny Smith, but Honey Crisps are also good. Depends on my mood. The main thing is it has to be crunchy. Same goes for peaches. You will never catch me biting into a soft peach.

Promoting Red Color in Apples

Color development in apples is a complex process because many factors are involved: genetics, environmental conditions (i.e., light and temperature), nutrition, stress, crop load, etc. Probably some of the most common causes for low red color development in apple orchards are excessive crop load, shaded canopies, and warm fall temperatures. Unfortunately, there isn’t much that we can do to control temperature in the orchards, and if the warm weather trends that we have experienced these weeks in August continue through September (it looks like we will have a warmer than normal September), there might be a delayed in color development.
At this point in the growing season there are a couple of managements that can be implemented to promote red color development. One of them is to use reflective mulches/films under the tree canopy. We recommend placing them about 3-4 weeks before harvest, and if you have narrow trees placing them just on the west side of the row. The other alternative to increase color development is to use plant growth regulators. There are two products that have shown good results in several research trials, Ethephon and Blush.
Ethephon (2 pint/ac) can improve color development when applied 1 week before harvest. Ethephon will stimulate fruit ripening so if applied more than 1 week before harvesting it will increase fruit drop, so be careful! If you are concerned about excessive fruit drop, you can combine ethephon with a preharvest drop product such as Fruitone. Blush, that contains jasmonates, has shown to moderately increase red color development without affecting fruit ripening or increasing early drop. Blush can be applied 2 to 4 weeks before harvest, but best results have been obtained when applied twice, at 3 and 1 weeks before harvest.

Anthocyanins are phytochemicals that provide some of the reds and purples found in flowers, wine, and fruit. The anthocyanins benefit the plant by attracting pollinators and benefit humans by acting as antioxidants in our diet (Khoo et al., 2017). The level of anthocyanins that accumulate in a plant depends on the environmental conditions. For example, light exposure influences anthocyanins to accumulate rapidly in apples (Malus domestica cv. “Red Fuji”), prompting a color change. However, the molecular mechanism that causes light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples remains unclear. In this issue, Huaying Ma, Tuo Yang, and colleagues (Ma et al. 2021) discovered a transcriptional cascade that regulates early stage, light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples.Previous studies have demonstrated that ethylene response factors (ERFs) are a class of transcription factors (TFs) that play a role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis (An et al., 2020). The authors used their previously published transcriptome database (Yang et al., 2019) to identify apple ERFs that were expressed 3 days after light treatment. One of these apple ERFs, MdERF109, was induced during the early stages of light treatment. Combining this result with high-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that anthocyanin accumulation strongly correlated with MdERF109 transcript levels. The authors hypothesized that MdERF109 functions in coloration by binding to the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Yeast-one-hybrid assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and transactivation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that MdERF109 binds and transcriptionally activates the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The strength of this paper was demonstrating their results consistently in planta, as transgenic manipulation of MdERF109 in apple calli and fruit showed that MdERF109 is sufficient to regulate anthocyanin content.Genes that are regulated by light tend to have light-responsive elements in their promoter sequence. However, Ma and colleagues were unable to find light-responsive elements in the MdERF109 promoter. Given that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) located upstream of target genes can induce expression of those genes via cis-acting modules, and that some lncRNAs are light-regulated, the authors hypothesized that an lncRNA might be responsible for regulating MdERF109 gene expression. After screening for the cis-pattern in an lncRNA sequencing database, the authors identified an apple lncRNA, MdLNC499, located ∼15kb from MdERF109. Using a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture analysis, a tool used to examine chromosomal spatial relationships between genes, the authors identified a region with strong cross-linking signal, suggesting that MdLNC499 has a cis-regulatory role in MdERF109 expression. Functional assays that overexpressed or silenced MdLNC499 in apple fruit and calli demonstrated that both anthocyanin accumulation and MdERF109 transcript levels are dependent on MdLNC499. These results suggest that MdLNC499 positively regulates MdERF109 expression to promote light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis.After discovering that MdLNC499 regulates MdERF109, the authors explored the sequence of MdLNC499 to determine if it contained any known cis-elements. W-box elements, required for WRKY TF binding, were indeed present in the MdLNC499 promoter, suggesting that this lncRNA is regulated by a WRKY TF. A follow-up RT-qPCR analysis showed that MdWRKY1 was induced following light treatment in apple. Biochemical and transactivation experiments demonstrated that MdWRKY1 can bind to the promoter of MdLNC499 and transcriptionally regulate it. These results were consistent in their functional assays in apple fruit and calli as MdWRKY1 positively regulated MdLNC499 and anthocyanin accumulation. Finally, by transiently silencing the expression of MdERF109, MdLNC499, and MdWRKY1 in the corresponding overexpressing transgenic calli, the authors were able to construct a MdWRKY1-MdLNC499-MdERF109 transcriptional cascade that regulates light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple (see Figure).Open in a separate windowFigureProposed model for how light promotes anthocyanin accumulation in apple fruit through the MdWRKY1-MdLNC499-MdERF109 transcriptional cascade. Light induces MdWRKY1 to activate the expression of MdLNC499 via a W-box in the promoter. MdLNC499 then promotes the expression of MdERF109, which subsequently targets the expression of downstream anthocyanin-related genes, promoting a change in coloration in apple. Reproduced from Ma et al. (2021), Figure 10.Revealing a mechanism of light-induced coloration presents possibilities of engineering this pathway to shorten or lengthen the time for a fruit to ripen. This is something that may prove to be critical with our world’s changing climate. So the next time you’re eating an apple and admiring its colors, you can also admire the transcriptional cascade involved in this process.Go to:References

In fact, it has a major influence on consumer choice. Skin color is, thus, one of the most important criteria taken into account by breeders. For apples, most novel varieties are so-called “mutants” or “sports” that have been identified in clonal populations. Indeed, many “sports” exist that show distinct phenotypic differences compared to the varieties from which they originated. These differences affect a limited number of traits of economic importance, including skin color. Until recently, the detailed genetic or epigenetic changes resulting in heritable phenotypic changes in sports was largely unknown. Recent technological advances and the availability of several high-quality apple genomes now provide the bases to understand the exact nature of the underlying molecular changes that are responsible for the observed phenotypic changes observed in sports. The present review investigates the molecular nature of sports affected in apple skin color giving arguments in favor of the genetic or epigenetic explanatory models.Keywords: epigenetics, genetics, skin color, apple, transposable element, transcriptome factorGo to:1. IntroductionApple skin color is one of the most important factors determining the acceptance and economic value of apples. The red coloration of the skin of an apple fruit is mainly attributed to anthocyanin pigmentation. Therefore, anthocyanin is key to improving our understanding of the genes and mechanisms involved in this trait.In Europe, distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) testing of fruit species is long and expensive compared to other crop sectors [1]. This process aims to determine whether a new variety is different from an existing variety within the same species (“distinctness”). Furthermore, it is used to determine whether distinctive traits are expressed uniformly (“uniformity”), and whether subsequent processes will change the phenotype of the generation (“stability”). The DUS test exists to allow new varieties to enter the market legally and allow plant breeders to protect their rights. Apple varieties appear to come about as clearly distinctive mutants, but certain apple mutants, for example derived from the “Gala” variety, may only show subtle phenotypic changes and are difficult to distinguish from each other, thus requiring long and expensive tests. To better distinguish these varieties, it is necessary to decipher the genetic or epigenetic origin of the skin color mutations, then to develop molecular genetic or epigenetic markers to help institutions such as the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) to accelerate testing of fruit species.Recently, numerous studies have investigated the roles of genetics and epigenetics in apple skin color development. The aim of this review is to bring together the findings of these articles and summarize the genetic and epigenetic regulation of apple skin color. This review gives arguments in favor of the genetic and epigenetic explanatory models and gives an overview of the research frontier.Go to:2. Anthocyanin Biosynthesis and Pigment CompositionApple skin color is determined by the contents of anthocyanins, carotenoids, and chlorophyll, as well as their distribution over the skin surface. Anthocyanin content plays an important role in the degree of coloring of red apples. The content and distribution patterns of anthocyanins in the skin are responsible for the different color phenotypes. With the same anthocyanin content, a higher chlorophyll content will make the skin color dark red, whereas a lower content will cause the skin color to be bright red [2,3].Anthocyanins are water-soluble flavonoids occurring naturally in plants and are widely distributed. Furthermore, anthocyanins are important in plants as secondary metabolites. So far, twenty-two major types of anthocyanins have been described in more than 250 species [4]. At present, five anthocyanin components have been studied extensively in the skin of apples: cyanidin-3-arabinoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin 3-galactosides, cyanidin-3-xylosides, and cyanidin-3-glucosides [5]. Among these anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-galactoside was found to be the most abundant in apple skin, accounting for about 80% of the total anthocyanin content [4].Anthocyanins play numerous roles in plants, most importantly in the reproductive organs. For example, anthocyanins can make flowers appear to be brightly colored to facilitate plant pollination [6]. In addition, anthocyanins can protect plants from low temperatures and other abiotic and biotic stresses [7]. Indeed, when plants are in a stressful environment, the accumulation of anthocyanins can have a protective role [8]. A well-known example is the reddening of the leaves of deciduous trees in autumn, induced by lower temperatures, to protect the plant from freezing damage [9]. In addition, studies have shown that anthocyanins can play an antioxidant role in plants; however, the proportion of anthocyanins with an antioxidant function in apples is only about 1–20% [10]. Anthocyanins are also an important indicator for evaluating fruit maturity. Generally, the content of anthocyanins will be relatively high when the fruit is mature.To study fruit color, we first need to inspect the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. This pathway has already been studied in detail—it starts with the biosynthesis of phenylalanine with the help of different enzymes and transcription factors (TFs) [11] (Figure 1).Open in a separate windowFigure 1Diagrammatic representation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in apples, according to Takos et al. [14]. PAL, Phe ammonia lyase; CHS, Chalcone synthase; CHI, chalcone isomerase; F3H, flavanone-3 b-hydroxylase; DFR, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; LDOX, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase. UFGT, UDP-glycose: flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase; FLS, flavonol synthase; GT, glycosyl transferase; LAR, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; ANR, anthocyanidin reductase.The biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments is influenced by two categories of genes. To the first category belong structural genes encoding enzymes, such as chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone isomerase (CHI), flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase (LDOX), and UDP-glucose: flavonoid-3-O-glycosyltransferase (UFGT). The second category comprises genes coding for regulatory proteins, which include a number of TFs that influence the intensity and pattern of anthocyanin accumulation. At least three protein families, namely MYB, bHLH, and WD40, are involved in the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis, but the specific classes and the genes involved in the biosynthesis vary depending on the species [12,13].Anthocyanins can accumulate in leaves, roots, and stocks [15], while regulatory proteins which involve in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway are localized in the cytosol. After biosynthesis, flavonoids are transported to vacuoles or cell walls [16]. Anthocyanins are upregulated by maturity and the formation of flavonoids, especially anthocyanin and chlorogenic acid in apple skin, which influence growth regulators and fruit maturity [17]. The signals or metabolite biosynthesis which influence the maturity of fruits also influence anthocyanin accumulation. For example, plant hormones (abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonates, auxin, gibberellin) have a crucial role in the regulation of fruit development and ripening. They interact with MYB–bHLH–WD40 complexes at either the transcriptional or the post-transcriptional level to control the anthocyanin composite [18]. Espley et al. [15] reported that the increased flux in the anthocyanin pathway was also associated with increases in metabolite concentrations of other polyphenols, including up to a 10-fold increase in quercetin-3-galactoside. Anthocyanins in the vacuole are degraded by peroxidases. The possible involvement of vacuolar peroxidases in anthocyanin degradation may be a component of the adaptation of plants to changing environmental conditions, such as decreased light intensities, but may also be a component of the plant developmental program [19].Rootstocks also link with apple skin color. From the 20th century, much research has been conducted on the subject. In a study using seven rootstocks, Rogers [20] observed the best color on fruit from “Bramley” trees grafted on “M9”. Tukey and Brase [21] and Blair [22] observed that red-colored cultivars developed higher color on “M”. Hewetson [23] and Upshall [24] found that the increase in red fruit color intensity found on some Malling rootstocks was due to earlier maturity date [25]. The amount of total phenolic compounds and flavonoids increased, which may be due to the influence of different rootstocks and the incompatibility between the rootstock and the scion or grafting wound. In one study, “Bud 9” rootstock generally had a negative effect on the amount of anthocyanin, while M9 increased the amount of anthocyanin [26]. Grafting of “Bekran” on “Bekran” rootstock and “Red Delicious” cultivar on “Bekran” decreased the anthocyanin in scion leaves, but when “Bastam” cultivar was grafted on this rootstock it increased the amount of anthocyanin [26].Go to:3. Genetic Determinants of Apple Skin Color3.1. MYB Transcription Factors Regulate Apple Skin ColorThe genetic mechanisms determining skin color in apple have been investigated in a number of studies [14,27,28]. MYB TFs have been reported to play an important role in plant secondary metabolism, especially the phenylalanine metabolism pathway. In particular, the well-studied MdMYB1, MdMYBA, and MdMYB10 genes code for TFs that were found to control the color of apple skin and flesh [14,27,28].MdMYB1 (Md: Malus × domestica) is a TF isolated and identified from apples that regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple skins. The transcriptional abundance of this gene was strongly regulated by light and positively correlated with anthocyanin accumulation [14]. Another study confirmed that light can make the MdMYB1 protein more stable, and therefore can enhance the anthocyanin synthesis of apple skin [29]. A further finding was that the promoter region of MdMYB1 is rich in polymorphisms [14]. Based on these polymorphisms, a set of dCAPS markers was designed based on MdMYB1-1, which had a dominant effect on fruit skin color [14]. Apples that have MdMYB1-1 will exhibit a red-skinned phenotype, whereas those that do not have the MdMYB1-1 allele will have yellow or green skin [14]. However, this MdMYB1 dCAPS marker was unable to identify alleles of the MdMYB1 gene in “Fuji” apples [30].In addition to MdMYB1, MdMYB10 and MdMYBA were isolated and found to be closely associated with the redness of apple skin and flesh [27,28]. Low temperature and UV-B (280 ~ 320nm) induced MdMYBA in different tissues. There were significant differences in expression levels between differently colored varieties [27]. Confirming its direct role in anthocyanin biosynthesis, it was shown that MdMYB10 overexpression could significantly enhance anthocyanin accumulation in transgenic apple seedlings [28].In recent research, the anthocyanin biosynthesis process has been proven to be more complex, with more genes, TFs, and interactions having been discovered. A number of other MYB TFs were found in the apple genome (Figure 2). Among them, MdMYB3 is involved in the transcriptional activation of several flavonoid biosynthesis pathway genes [31]. In addition, it not only regulates anthocyanin accumulation in the apple skin, but also participates in the regulation of flower development [31]. Recently, another MYB TF, MdMYB16, was described, which could form homodimers and directly inhibit anthocyanin synthesis through its C-terminal EAR (ethylene responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression) repressor [32]. MdMYB16 was shown to interact with a bHLH family TF MdbHLH33 to weaken inhibition of anthocyanin synthesis [32]. More recently, a light-responsive MYB-like gene called MdMYBDL1 was found [33]. It functions downstream of MdHY5, which coordinates light signal transduction and regulates the expression of flower color [33]. MdHY5 activates the expression of MdMYBDL1, while MdMYBDL1 inhibited the transcription of MdMYB16 and its homolog MdMYB308, which are inhibitors of anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples. This means that MdHY5 is able to promote anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples (Figure 2) [32]. These results indicate that MdHY5 enhances apple anthocyanins synthesis by acting on different types of MYB TFs [33]. In addition, MdMYB9 and MdMYB11 were found to bind to the promoters of structural genes, such as a bHLH TF MdbHLH3 and WD repeat protein TTG1 to regulate anthocyanin and PA accumulation [34]. Moreover, two putative flavonoid-related genes, MdMYB12 (proanthocyanidin-specific TF) and MdMYB22 (flavonol-specific TF), were found to directly facilitate the expression of leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR) and flavonol synthase (FLS), respectively [35]. MdMYB12 is thought to interact with bHLH3 and bHLH33, which are regulators of anthocyanin synthesis in apples [28], and to facilitate the expression of LAR and promote proanthocyanidin synthesis. Furthermore, MdMYB22 activates flavonol pathways by directly combining with the flavonol synthase (FLS) promoter [35]. Among the MYB TFs, MdMYB111 was found to bind the MYB recognition element (MRE) of the MdANS (anthocyanidin synthase) promoter and to potentially inhibit anthocyanin biosynthesis [36]. MdWRKY40 was found to form homodimers and to bind to the W box of the MdANS promoter. In addition, it was shown to reduce the inhibitory effect of MdMYB111 on anthocyanin biosynthesis. This means that both MdMYB111 and MdWRKY40 are important regulatory elements of the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (Figure 2) [36].Open in a separate windowFigure 2Diagrammatic representation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway and the related TFs in apples. Green arrows indicate TFs activating enzymes in the pathway, while orange barred lines signify a TF inhibiting enzyme expression in the pathway.In addition to MYBs, other TFs are involved in regulating anthocyanin synthesis and transport. Anthocyanins are biosynthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and are then transported into the vacuole for storage [37]. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are thought to be responsible for the transport of anthocyanins into the vacuole in apples [38]. MdGSTF6 encodes an important GST transporter of anthocyanins in apple fruit and its expression is activated by MdMYB1, providing evidence for the related regulatory mechanisms [39]. Therefore, MdMYB1 is thought to not only regulate anthocyanin synthesis, but also to control anthocyanin transport in apples [39]. A nitrate-induced LBD (lateral organ boundaries domain) TF gene, MdLBD13, has been discovered, which can repress anthocyanin biosynthesis by downregulating the expression of genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis, such as MdMYB1, MdMYB9/11, and MdbHLH3/33, resulting in reduced anthocyanin accumulation [40]. MdLBD13 could, thus, play the role of a negative regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis [40].In conclusion, MYB TFs, especially those encoded by MdMYB1, MdMYBA, and MdMYB10 genes, play important roles in the regulation of apple skin color [14,27,28]. However, a number of other MYB family genes also control the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, such as the aforementioned MdMYB3, MdMYB9, MdMYB11, MdMYB12, MdMYB16, MdMYB22, MdMYBDL1, MdMYB111, and MdMYB308. Their effects in the anthocyanin pathway are shown in Figure 2.3.2. Genetic MappingSince the 1990s, numerous quantitative genetics studies on apples have allowed the location of a huge number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) and major genes linked to the major agronomical traits. Amongst these, only a few were concerned with polyphenol compounds [41,42,43]. A small number of genetic studies have been performed to decipher red pigmentation in apple. Since apple skin color is one of the main factors defining the commercial value of apples, several genetic studies have been performed to decipher its locations in the genetic maps of apples. These studies have been performed thanks to the availability of different kinds of molecular markers, such as single sequence repeats (SSRs) [44]. However, the bulk of the studies used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) [41,45,46,47], which are the most abundant type of DNA sequence polymorphisms [48]. These were based on different origins and kinds of plant materials, such as segregating populations [41,45,46,49] and cultivar populations, through genome wide analysis studies (GWAS). The results of all these studies are convergent, showing that MdMYB10 and MdMYB1 are the two main transcription factors involved in the regulation of red skin color in apples [44]. As MdMYB1 and MdMYBA share identical sequences and MdMYB10 and MdMYB1 genes are located at very similar positions, sharing 98% homology on linkage group 9, it was concluded that these genes were allelic [27,28,50,51]. In addition, MYB TFs also influence red-flesh apples, of which there are normally two types. In type 1, red pigmentation is observed from the fruit set through to maturity, exhibiting red fruit skin, leaves, stems, roots, and flowers. In type 2, red pigmentation is only present in the fruit cortex at the late stage of fruit development and the leaves are green [52,53]. Differences in anthocyanin accumulation in the red flesh type 2 apples have been associated with one SNP marker close to the MdMYB10 homolog MdMYB110a, which is physically located on LG 17 [52].The last genetic mapping results identified alleles of SSRs and SNPs markers that could be used in molecular assisted breeding [42,44,45,47]. However, these studies cannot assist in the distinction of apple mutants (e.g., Gala), which show very tiny differences in skin coloration. For this, new approaches need to be developed.3.3. Copy Number VariationsCopy number variations (CNVs) are defined as deletions, duplications, or insertions of DNA sequence fragments longer than 50 base pairs in length [54]. CNVs have the potential to influence genes by altering their structure and expression [55]. CNVs are a common feature of plant genomes that include non-global duplication and deletion events [55].Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have greatly facilitated the discovery of CNVs [56]. Using NGS data, copy number variable regions (CNVRs) within the apple genome were detected, as well as examined for their distribution and impact [55]. In total, 876 CNVRs accounting for 3.5% of the apple genome were identified. The enrichment of the CNVRs with gene loci of agronomical significance has drawn attention to these newly discovered forms of genetic variation in apples [55].Notably, some MYB TFs were found to have CNVs that could be linked to apple fruit coloration. For instance, a rearrangement in the upstream regulatory region of the gene encoding the MdMYB10 was detected [57]. This rearrangement includes a series of multiple repeats, forming a microsatellite-like structure, featuring five direct tandem repeats of a 23 bp sequence. This MdMYB10 rearrangement was only present in red-fleshed apple varieties and was not observed in white-fleshed varieties. Transient analysis showed that the 23 bp sequence motif is a target for the MdMYB10 protein itself, and the number of repeat units is related to the increase in transactivation by MdMYB10 [57]. The red-fleshed phenotype is also associated with enhanced expression of MdMYB110a (paralog of MdMYB10) [52]. Functional characterization of MYB110a showed that it could upregulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.). MdMYB10 (LG 9) and MdMYB110a (LG 17) have conserved functions in some varieties, but their expression and response to fruit maturity are different. MdMYB10 was found to be expressed in apple skin, flesh, and foliage, while MdMYB110a was found to only be expressed in the fruit cortex [52]. Other anthocyanin-related MYBs were selected from a number of plant species, including apple, pear, strawberry, petunia, kiwifruit, and Arabidopsis thaliana, to initiate promoters containing the R6 motif, which has six minisatellite repeat units thought to increase anthocyanin pigmentation [58]. Insertion of the apple R6 motif into the MYB10 orthologous promoter of pear (PcMYB10) and Arabidopsis (AtMY75) was able to increase anthocyanin levels [58].In conclusion, copy number differences could be used as markers for apple color, especially MdMYB10 and MdMYB110a (summarized in Table 1).Table 1Overview of CNVs for apple color characteristics.Related GeneCNV Length LGReference

Transposable ElementsTransposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous mobile genetic factors that can make up more than 50% of a plant’s nuclear genome [59]. They can be divided into two broad classes according to their method of proliferation [60,61]. Class I elements transpose by reverse transcription of RNA intermediates, and once inserted into a new location in the genome they cannot be removed [60,61]. This class includes retrotransposons and potential retroviruses with long terminal repeats (LTR), as well as non-LTR elements, including long and short interspersed nuclear elements (LINE and SINE, respectively) and processed pseudogenes [60,61]. Class II elements (also called DNA transposons) can be excised and inserted, and thus move from one nuclear position to another [60,61]. Some coding factors mediate their own transposition, while others are non-autonomous, depending on the activity of the transposase encoded at a separate site [60,61,62].TEs are usually methylated via small RNAs, and this methylation can extend to surrounding genes, making them inactive [63,64]. The role played by retrotransposons in plant genomes is well known—by self-replication and insertion into multiple genomic sites [65,66], they have an influence on the size, structure, function, and evolution of plant genomes. Retrotransposons, thus, are an important source of genetic diversity; they may cause changes that could lead to genetic variations within plant species [66,67].TEs account for 60% of the apple genome in the final assembly and provide insights into its evolution [68]. LTR retrotransposons (LRNs) are the most abundant type of TEs [69,70]. There is evidence that TEs affect the appearance of some genetic variation in the color of pome fruits [71]. Recently, a gypsy-like LTR retrotransposon (denoted as redTE) was found inserted in the upstream of the MdMYB1 promoter and could be associated with red coloration [72]. The redTE controlled the development of red coloration by lowering the threshold of light response. This insertion appears in the HFTH1 (“Hanfu”, which has bright red skin color) genome and is located −3297 bp upstream of the ATG initiation codon of MdMYB1 [72]. This redTE has two target site duplications (TSDs) and two identical flanking LTR sequences (1274 bp). Furthermore, redTE-mediated control of anthocyanin distribution patterns manipulates MdMYB1 function through the creation of genetic and epigenetic alleles under natural conditions [72].It is noteworthy that TEs were found to be associated with coloration in other fruit species. For example, in blood oranges, two different TE inserts are responsible for the cold-induced Ruby expression, thereby regulating fruit color [73]. In grapes, a Gypsy-like retrotransposon called Gret1 inhibited the expression of MYBA1, while the retrotransposon is linked with the development of white-skinned berries [74,75]. The recombination between Gret1 LTRs caused some restoration of MYB gene function and blush-skinned sports, including “Flame Muscat” and “Chardonnay Rose” [73,76]. Furthermore, it remains to be seen whether similar redTE insertions could enhance MYB transcription in other Rosaceae fruit species [72,73]. These findings strongly suggest that TE insertions may also play key roles in influencing traits of interest in apples.In conclusion, redTE-mediated control of the distribution patterns of anthocyanin accumulation is exerted through the creation of genetic and epigenetic alleles that manipulate the function of MdMYB1 under natural conditions. This suggests that some TEs and retrotransposon elements are linked with the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in apple skin. Therefore, we will next look at the epigenetic determinants of apple skin color.Go to:4. Epigenetic Determinants of Apple Skin ColorIn addition to genetic factors, some epigenetic factors can also affect apple skin color. Epigenetics describe mitotically or meiotically heritable variations in gene expression that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence [77,78,79]. Thus, epigenetics refers to the study of heritable changes in gene transcription that do not involve changes in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic marks can be transferred from one generation to the next [79,80]. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is achieved through DNA methylation and specific histone modifications [79,81].4.1. DNA Methylation and DemethylationDNA methylation can be highly stable and inherited in a mendelian manner. This was demonstrated by experiments with 30 consecutive generations of plants in Arabidopsis thaliana [79,82]. In plants, DNA methylation has three sequence contexts: CG, CHG, and CHH (H = A, T, or C) [83]. One of the key activities of DNA methylation is the silencing of TFs to prevent their transcription and mobility.Emerging evidence suggests that a modification in DNA methylation is also important for the ripening of fleshy fruits [84]. In tomatoes, the VTE3 gene regulates the vitamin E content in fruits. VTE3 expression is linked with the TE methylation level in the promoter region [85]. In sweet oranges, a DNA methylation inhibitor, by stopping further increase in DNA methylation, could prevent fruit from degreening [86]. Some studies have investigated the role of epigenetics in apples, comparing specific varieties and their mutants that produce fruit with a stable pigment pattern or different skin phenotypes, respectively. For example, mutants of “Honeycrisp” or “Fuji” can produce fruit with two different kinds of patterns,—striped and blushed. In “Honeycrisp”, DNA methylation at the MdMYB10 promoter was detected’ increased DNA methylation levels were observed in green stripes, and a 900 bp long sequence, starting 1400 bp upstream of the translation start site, was highly methylated in MdMYB10 [71]. Another example concerns varieties derived from “Gala”, with “Kidd’s D-8” (KID) being the red-skinned mutant and “Blondee” (BLO) being the yellow-skinned mutant [38]. Two regions, MR3 and MR7, exist in the MdMYB10 promotor that showed significant differences between BLO and KID. Methylation was found to be higher and gradually increased during fruit development of BLO, whereas in KID it was lower and constant. The higher levels of DNA methylation reduced MdMYB10 transcription, and thus anthocyanin production [38]. In “Hanfu”, DNA was also methylated in the MR3 and MR7 regions in MdMYB1; in the MR8-MR11 regions, the degree of methylation of redTE was high. This suggests that redTE-induced epigenetic changes may be related to variable color patterns [72].DNA methylation could modify both regulatory and structural genes in the anthocyanin pathway. In apple skin, differential changes in methylation patterns related to anthocyanin concentrations have been reported [87]. Two differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were linked to the anthocyanin pathway: MdANS and MdF3H. These genes were up regulated in apple mutants, and differences in the methylation patterns of their promoters were observed [87]. The transcription of structural genes may be regulated by both changes in TF levels and DNA methylation. Additionally, the expression of the TF MdMYB114 was upregulated in deep-skinned apples [87]. In “Fuji”, the methylation in three ‘mutants with different colors was detected, and it was found that the CHH methylation level in the MR3 region (–1246 to –780) of the MdMYB1 promoter was negatively correlated with MdMYB1 expression [88]. MdAGO4, which plays a key role in RNA-directed DNA methylation, is required for CHH methylation, which was found to interact with the MdMYB1 promoter. The promoter of MdMYB1 was found to be methylated through binding of MdAGO4 to this gene’s promoter, thereby regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis [88].Methylation of cytosine in the genome of eukaryotes is often related to repeats, including TEs and their derivatives. Such sequences are usually enriched in centromeres and their vicinity [79]. It was confirmed that the differential accumulation of MdMYB1-specific mRNA was causing the difference in anthocyanin levels between “Granny Smith” and “Golden Delicious” [89]. The methylation level of the promoter region was linked to different levels of MdMYB1 transcripts in the two varieties. The formation of red pigment in the skin of “Granny Smith” is related to the hypomethylation of the MdMYB1 promoter [89].Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is a useful method of detection for methylation differences between different color mutants. Using this method, Li et al. [90] found the methylation relationship between Red Delicious (G0) and its four-generation bud sport mutants (G1 to G4) [90]. The phenotypes of the mutants were different and the pigmentation in the apple skin gradually increased from G0 to G4 [91]. The phenotype of these mutants in Red Delicious was obviously linked with the difference in DNA methylation [90]. Furthermore, in some flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes (including CHS, PAL, F3’H, PER, 4CL, CYP98A, and CCoAOMT), the mCHG and mCG contexts are hypomethylated; the mCHG contexts upstream of MdMYB10 especially cause the transcriptional activation and increase anthocyanin accumulation. However, the methylation of the mCG context upstream of bHLH74 causes transcriptional repression and inhibits the accumulation of anthocyanin [90]. In summary, methylation is linked with apple skin coloration and patterning. Furthermore, higher levels of DNA methylation reduced MdMYB10 expression, and thus anthocyanin production [88].In addition to accumulation of DNA methylation having an influence on the anthocyanin pathway, demethylation is also linked to its regulation. Bagging treatment could induce epigenetic changes. Ma et al. [89] compared DNA methylation levels in the 2 kb upstream region of MdMYB1 in bag-treated apples after removal of the bags and unbagged controls. There was a correlation between hypomethylation and the red-skinned phenotype in “Granny Smith” apples [89]. Granny Smith fruits responded to treatment with an inhibitor of DNA methylation, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), an analog of cytosine that can inhibit the activity of DNA methyltransferases. These drug treatments effectively limited DNA methylation and induced color phenotype variants [92,93]. In Granny Smith, after bag removal and 5-aza-dC treatments, some MdMYB1 promoter regions showed reduced DNA methylation. This could indicate a 5-aza-dC-treatment-induced activation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Granny Smith skin [89]. Ma et al. [94] performed another study in the same year to compare the transcriptomes of Granny Smith skin with and without 5-aza-dC treatment after bagging [94]. They found many differentially expressed genes through 5-aza-dC-treated and non-treated apples, including TF genes and anthocyanin accumulation-related genes. Demethylation treatments were linked to differential gene expression, while the regulatory mechanisms were associated with red pigmentation in “Granny Smith” apples and other non-red apple fruits [94]. Demethylation also enhanced the expression of MdMYB1-2 and MdMYB1-3 and induced the accumulation of anthocyanin in “Mutsu”, which was obtained from a yellow-skinned cultivar [95]. Some cases of demethylation were documented for Fuji mutants. Usually, Fuji fruit exhibit a striped pattern; however, “Beni Shogun”, one of its mutants, has blushed skin. The difference in methylation between Fuji and Beni Shogun was linked to reduced DNA methylation at MR7 in the MdMYB10 promoter, which increased full redness in the skin of these apples [96].From this part, we can conclude that both gain and loss of DNA methylation can influence the anthocyanin pathway (Table 2). Furthermore, DNA methylation might inhibit anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple skin, while demethylation seems to induce it. However, epigenetic levels are different in different organizations and in different developmental stages in plants [97]. The methylation is inherited but is less stable which depending upon the environment [97]. For example, the chestnut methylation level decreases with the age of the tree [98]. Epialleles or epimutations can generate stable and heritable changes of fruit phenotypes [99]. However, in some situations epialleles could be less stable and the apple mutant skin color could revert to the original apple color; the reason causing this change is still unknown. These scientific questions still need to be researched in the future.Table 2Overview of methylation and demethylation in apple color characteristics.Related GeneOver (+) or under (−) MethylatedEffect on TranscriptionReference

Histone ModificationsIn recent years, there has been evidence suggesting that a conserved histone H2 variant, H2A.Z, and histone methylation are associated with the regulation of gene transcription in different organisms throughout the genome [100,101]. However, little is known about the roles of these two types of epigenetic regulation in the control of anthocyanin biosynthesis. The conserved histone H2 variant, H2A.Z, negatively controls the accumulation of anthocyanin in Arabidopsis [102]. H2A.Z and H3K4me3 have an antagonistic effect on the transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, which highlights a role of chromatin in gene regulation and reflects the complexity of gene regulatory mechanisms [102].Bagging treatment could induce epigenetic changes and the histone levels could be different in different regions of transcribed genes. This treatment was able to turn the normally non-red apple variety “Mutsu” into a red one. Furthermore, the histone H3K4me3 was found to be higher in the 5′ upstream region of MdMYB1-2/-3, while H3k27me3 was lower [95]. H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in the 5′ upstream region of MdMYB1-2/-3 were associated with the paper-bagging-induced red pigmentation. The modifications of the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 could induce the expression of MdMYB1-2/-3 in some regions [95].An example for the link between histones and anthocyanin accumulation can be found in Arabidopsis. A HD-ZIP II TF HAT1 negatively regulates the accumulation of anthocyanin through post-translational regulation of the MYB-bHLH-WD40 (MBW) protein complex [103]. MYB75 was found to form a transcriptional repressor complex with HAT1-TPL through the deacetylation of histone H3 at the target gene in Arabidopsis [103]. It was indicated that HAT1 inhibited the formation of MBW protein complexes and recruited TPL core inhibitors to epigenetically regulate the anthocyanin late biosynthesis genes (LBGs), thereby inhibiting the activity of MBW protein complexes, and thus anthocyanin accumulation [103]. In maize, the basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) protein R interacts with the MYB TF C1 and R-interacting factor 1 (RIF1) to form a C1-R-RIF1 complex [104]. This complex binds to the A1 promoter and activates A1 expression through increasing H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation levels in the promoter region [104].In conclusion, identifying the interaction between MBW protein complexes and epigenetic regulators remains challenging [103]. How the histones regulate structural genes or TFs in the anthocyanins biosynthetic pathway in apple skin is still a complex question and an interesting subject that needs to be studied by subsequent researchers.4.3. Small RNAsRecently, in various organisms, small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identified as key genetic and epigenetic regulators, being involved in histone methylation and DNA modification to regulate the abundance of coding or non-coding RNAs [105]. In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the main regulatory RNA species [105]. The former are mainly involved in post-transcriptional regulation, while the latter are linked with transcriptional regulation [105]. Many of these characteristic sRNAs are related to numerous biological programs, processes, and pathways in response to developmental cues, environmental stress, pathogen infection, and pest infestation [105].In apples, miR828 and miR858 regulate a large number of MYB genes through targeting the region encoding the conserved R3 domain of the MYB protein [106]. MiR828 triggered the targeting of MYB genes to produce secondary phasiRNAs (phased siRNAs), thereby enhancing its silencing effect. Most MYBs for miR828 are linked with primary and secondary metabolism related to anthocyanin production [106]. Among them, there are nine MYBs co-targeted by miR828 and miR858, which are involved in the regulation of proanthocyanidin biosynthesis [106]. Xia et al. [106] conducted an analysis of 81 MYBs—29 MYBs were identified as targets, most of which are mainly involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis [106]. In tomato, miR858 plays a negative role in anthocyanin biosynthesis—blocking miR858 can increase the accumulation of anthocyanin by regulating the expression of SlMYB7 and SlMYB4861 [107].The RdDM pathway could influence fruit coloration in different apple mutants. Jiang et al. [88] systematically studied the causes of coloring differences in different apple bud varieties and found that there was a significant negative correlation between the content of anthocyanin in the skin and the CHH methylation level of the TF MdMYB1 promoter. CHH methylation is primarily mediated by the RdDM pathway [88]. The RdDM pathway AGO protein MdAGO4-1/2 was found to interact with the apple MdMYB1 promoter. In the apple callus, overexpression of MdAGO4s and MdDRM2s can increase the CHH methylation level at the MdMYB1 promoter, thus affecting the accumulation of anthocyanins in apples [88]. In summary, apple MdAGO4s bind to ABS (AGO4 binding site) on the MdMYB1 promoter, recruit the DNA methyltransferase MdDRM2, and exert a DNA methylation function. On the other hand, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) mediate the methylation of MdAGO4 binding site, thereby modifying the MdMYB1 promoter, affecting its expression and regulating fruit color [88].lncRNA could also be linked to anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples [108]. During light-induced rapid anthocyanin accumulation, RNA-seq analysis of apple skin of the “Red Fuji” variety revealed 5297 putative lncRNAs [108]. Differential expression analysis further showed that lncRNAs involved in photosynthesis during light treatment were transcribed [108]. It was predicted that two differentially expressed lncRNAs, MLNC3.2 and MLNC4.6, are potential endogenous target mimics (eTMs) for miRNA156a, which can prevent cleavage of SPL2-like and SPL33 during light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis [108]. SPL (squamosa promoter-binding protein-like) interacts with MYB TFs and coordinates the biosynthesis of anthocyanins during the exposure of apple skin [108]. This research provides basic insights into the involvement of lncRNA in anthocyanin biosynthesis pathways of apple fruits [108].In conclusion, small RNAs are now widely recognized as key genetic and epigenetic regulatory factors in various organisms and biosynthesis pathways, including that of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Small RNAs such as miR828 and miR858 seem to synergistically regulate a large number of MYB genes by directly targeting the region encoding the conserved R3 domain of the MYB protein.Go to:5. ConclusionsIn this review, we have summarized the recent research on the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms affecting the buildup of apple skin color. Most studies have investigated the genetic part of fruit coloring, with a focus on the genes in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, such as the MdMYB1 gene, which is linked with apple skin color. However, evidence on the role of epigenetics in the development of fruit color and patterns is now mounting. A number of tasks remain to be performed in the future—this review has shown a surprisingly large variety of regulatory mechanisms involved in a host of different genetic and epigenetic factors underlying the expression of skin coloration in apple fruit. Although the number of studies dedicated to the topic is impressive, more work still needs to be performed to clarify the roles of certain factors, especially when mechanisms seem to be redundant or complementary. In addition, from a more practical point of view, breeding of certain apple varieties would benefit from the development of genetic and epigenetic markers. This would allow apple breeders to better and more reliably distinguish apple mutants, saving them time and money.Go to:AcknowledgmentsThanks are due to the members of thesis committee for helpful advice in writing this review: Andrea Patocchi, Charles-Eric Durel, David Rousseau, Mohamed Zouine, and Sylvain Guyot.

Anthocyanins are phytochemicals that provide some of the reds and purples found in flowers, wine, and fruit. The anthocyanins benefit the plant by attracting pollinators and benefit humans by acting as antioxidants in our diet (Khoo et al., 2017). The level of anthocyanins that accumulate in a plant depends on the environmental conditions. For example, light exposure influences anthocyanins to accumulate rapidly in apples (Malus domestica cv. “Red Fuji”), prompting a color change. However, the molecular mechanism that causes light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples remains unclear. In this issue, Huaying Ma, Tuo Yang, and colleagues (Ma et al. 2021) discovered a transcriptional cascade that regulates early stage, light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apples.Previous studies have demonstrated that ethylene response factors (ERFs) are a class of transcription factors (TFs) that play a role in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis (An et al., 2020). The authors used their previously published transcriptome database (Yang et al., 2019) to identify apple ERFs that were expressed 3 days after light treatment. One of these apple ERFs, MdERF109, was induced during the early stages of light treatment. Combining this result with high-performance liquid chromatography analyses showed that anthocyanin accumulation strongly correlated with MdERF109 transcript levels. The authors hypothesized that MdERF109 functions in coloration by binding to the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Yeast-one-hybrid assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and transactivation assays in Nicotiana benthamiana demonstrated that MdERF109 binds and transcriptionally activates the promoters of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. The strength of this paper was demonstrating their results consistently in planta, as transgenic manipulation of MdERF109 in apple calli and fruit showed that MdERF109 is sufficient to regulate anthocyanin content.Genes that are regulated by light tend to have light-responsive elements in their promoter sequence. However, Ma and colleagues were unable to find light-responsive elements in the MdERF109 promoter. Given that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) located upstream of target genes can induce expression of those genes via cis-acting modules, and that some lncRNAs are light-regulated, the authors hypothesized that an lncRNA might be responsible for regulating MdERF109 gene expression. After screening for the cis-pattern in an lncRNA sequencing database, the authors identified an apple lncRNA, MdLNC499, located ∼15kb from MdERF109. Using a high-throughput chromosome conformation capture analysis, a tool used to examine chromosomal spatial relationships between genes, the authors identified a region with strong cross-linking signal, suggesting that MdLNC499 has a cis-regulatory role in MdERF109 expression. Functional assays that overexpressed or silenced MdLNC499 in apple fruit and calli demonstrated that both anthocyanin accumulation and MdERF109 transcript levels are dependent on MdLNC499. These results suggest that MdLNC499 positively regulates MdERF109 expression to promote light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis.After discovering that MdLNC499 regulates MdERF109, the authors explored the sequence of MdLNC499 to determine if it contained any known cis-elements. W-box elements, required for WRKY TF binding, were indeed present in the MdLNC499 promoter, suggesting that this lncRNA is regulated by a WRKY TF. A follow-up RT-qPCR analysis showed that MdWRKY1 was induced following light treatment in apple. Biochemical and transactivation experiments demonstrated that MdWRKY1 can bind to the promoter of MdLNC499 and transcriptionally regulate it. These results were consistent in their functional assays in apple fruit and calli as MdWRKY1 positively regulated MdLNC499 and anthocyanin accumulation. Finally, by transiently silencing the expression of MdERF109, MdLNC499, and MdWRKY1 in the corresponding overexpressing transgenic calli, the authors were able to construct a MdWRKY1-MdLNC499-MdERF109 transcriptional cascade that regulates light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in apple (see Figure).Open in a separate windowFigureProposed model for how light promotes anthocyanin accumulation in apple fruit through the MdWRKY1-MdLNC499-MdERF109 transcriptional cascade. Light induces MdWRKY1 to activate the expression of MdLNC499 via a W-box in the promoter. MdLNC499 then promotes the expression of MdERF109, which subsequently targets the expression of downstream anthocyanin-related genes, promoting a change in coloration in apple. Reproduced from Ma et al. (2021), Figure 10.Revealing a mechanism of light-induced coloration presents possibilities of engineering this pathway to shorten or lengthen the time for a fruit to ripen. This is something that may prove to be critical with our world’s changing climate. So the next time you’re eating an apple and admiring its colors, you can also admire the transcriptional cascade involved in this process.Go to:References

I have heard folks use this term all of my life…  there are reports all over of folks that love June apples.
Technically they are best when picked on the 4th of July… but if u want sour power you eat them in June.    Much later than 4th of July and they rot.

 krismoriah:

This part isnt accurate, to my knowledge. Both are from Russia. Both come relatively true from seed. Antanovka is a fall apple. Its a bit similar in appearance, but gets a red blush on it. Its hard and very tart. Antanovka was bred the infamous Ivan Michurin, I believe, and he is remembered in part for bringing apples to the coldest parts of Russia

Well i didnt want to be the one to correct Cliff…  i figured my old method of posting something wrong to get the right answer would work…and it did.
Regardless i need one in my life.

Considering that here in Alaska June is when all of my trees are just starting to flower up…
Tart and early varieties do not go hand in hand. As I said trees here start super late and the season ends in the first week of October, so just about every tree we grow is an early variety. There are plenty of sub tart early apples out there.
We do have an issue where some of the best hard cider varieties are late season but you can still find some good ones to compensate.

June apples are mostly an Appalachian thing… as far as i can tell.
More sophisticated places would likely want a Granny Smith.
My memories make sense… we were on summer break from school and the apples were perfect eating in mid June.
Riding your bike or spending a weekend with other boys those apples would fill up sacks and we would eat the heck out of them…   Some boys got stomach aches and pooped.
A good kid would bring a couple of pokes of them to their mom and she would fry up a big iron skillet of pork chops and biscuits.     Fry the apples up in the pork chop grease and sugar and vanilla.
I dont think it gets any better than that.

The number one reason why June apples are disappearing is because supply chains keep all sorts of apple available year around. Yellow transparent is a fine June apple, slightly acidic, sweet, not tart at all, but in the marketplace it can compete with say Honey Crisp or Fuji, which through the magic of refrigeration and worldwide transport is available nowhere near when it is ripening in your area.
If you are growing your own produce and you want a June apple there are sweet options available.

What are your top early varieties? There are some transparent crosses available. ‘Lodi’ sounds like it might be good. I like ‘mantet’. Some of the better summer apples can hang for a long time and sweeten up. ‘Rambo’ is one. I have another that cane labeled as ‘summer red’, not sure thats the proper name (probably not). Its ready in early August but hangs through mid-september and gets sweeter and redder. Those types are good for home production since you dont have to deal with them all in a go.

There are early apples called May apples…also one called ‘Horse’ apple.
I remember getting bushels of ‘horse apples’  for my horses and to be honest they were pretty danged good.   I havent seen them since i was a kid though.  Was sold at the local feed store.  May have been apples with worms and stuff that were unsellable… i dont remember.  I do know that we ate them and also there was some horse feed with molasses in it that tasted good…

The June Apples we used to grow include Yellow Transparent, Lodi, Pristine, Summer Rambo, Williams  Favorite and Carolina Red June.
They make great applesauce or stewed or baked but had no real storage life even when refrigerated.
I like Pristine the most with Rambo second but I’m sure my poor area for Apples may tilt their flavor.
Thought Lodi and Yellow Transparent tasted similar. Did not like Williams Favorite or Carolina Red June
We removed all the summer apples when folks refused to buy them.  They got soft and mushy very quickly . Had to sell them quickly or loose them.
They did avoid most of the insect and disease problems that hit the fall Apples and required almost no spray.

Lodi and Yellow transparent are very similar tasting apples. Yellow Transparent makes the best applesauce in the world. I think Lodi is a cross of Yellow Transparent. I’m growing yellow transparent on an upright espalier. Apparently it is tip bearing or semi tip bearing. I’m hoping to get it to fruit in 2025.

We have no June apples here, the earliest apples  ripen mid-July. Here are my ripening notes from last year (2022).
July:
11 - 25 Roter Astrachan apple
20 - 21 Yellow Transparent apple
21 First Pfirsichroter Sommerapfel (last not recorded)
25 First Piros apple, propably for two weeks (not recorded)
So if yellow transparent is a june apple for you, Red Astrachan should be one too. Piros is the first apple on this list that keeps somewhat, all others are best eaten immediately.

about 90% of the old apple trees around here are yellow transparent or a seedling of them. it was one of the few apples that could survive and fruit here. most of my generation and older were raised on these apples. we would start to eat them when they were still light green and hard. i still consider them the best in pies and applesauce. we used to can 15-20 gal. of applesauce every summer from wild forged ones around here. its been thought that the original trees were brought here with the French missionaries coming from Quebec. they ripen mid to late july here.

we would go trout fishing in the brooks as kids this time of year and on our way back on our bikes, there was a big y. transparent tree near the road in a field. we would eat the hell out of them because we were so thirsty. got the runs afterward every time but we kept doing it every year. a well grown y. transparent has waxy, dark green leaves which accentuates the yellow fruits color. it’s a quite beautiful tree.

krismoriahJul '23I have heard folks use this term all of my life…  there are reports all over of folks that love June apples.
Technically they are best when picked on the 4th of July… but if u want sour power you eat them in June.    Much later than 4th of July and they rot.

June Apple - AKA- Early Transparent - pale-yellow skin that matches the flesh. Crisp, light and sweet – makes the ultimate home-cooked applesauce., circa 1870. Cold-hardy. Ripens in June to July is known as Antonovka an Antique variety originates from Russia.

 krismoriah:

This part isnt accurate, to my knowledge. Both are from Russia. Both come relatively true from seed. Antanovka is a fall apple. Its a bit similar in appearance, but gets a red blush on it. Its hard and very tart. Antanovka was bred the infamous Ivan Michurin, I believe, and he is remembered in part for bringing apples to the coldest parts of Russia2 Replies3
krismoriahJul '23Well i didnt want to be the one to correct Cliff…  i figured my old method of posting something wrong to get the right answer would work…and it did.
Regardless i need one in my life.3
don1357RegularJul '23Considering that here in Alaska June is when all of my trees are just starting to flower up…
Tart and early varieties do not go hand in hand. As I said trees here start super late and the season ends in the first week of October, so just about every tree we grow is an early variety. There are plenty of sub tart early apples out there.
We do have an issue where some of the best hard cider varieties are late season but you can still find some good ones to compensate.1
krismoriahJul '23June apples are mostly an Appalachian thing… as far as i can tell.
More sophisticated places would likely want a Granny Smith.
My memories make sense… we were on summer break from school and the apples were perfect eating in mid June.
Riding your bike or spending a weekend with other boys those apples would fill up sacks and we would eat the heck out of them…   Some boys got stomach aches and pooped.
A good kid would bring a couple of pokes of them to their mom and she would fry up a big iron skillet of pork chops and biscuits.     Fry the apples up in the pork chop grease and sugar and vanilla.
I dont think it gets any better than that.1 Reply6
don1357RegularJul '23The number one reason why June apples are disappearing is because supply chains keep all sorts of apple available year around. Yellow transparent is a fine June apple, slightly acidic, sweet, not tart at all, but in the marketplace it can compete with say Honey Crisp or Fuji, which through the magic of refrigeration and worldwide transport is available nowhere near when it is ripening in your area.
If you are growing your own produce and you want a June apple there are sweet options available.2
