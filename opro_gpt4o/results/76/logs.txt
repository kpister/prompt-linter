12. "Debunking Myths About Sustainable Living"
13. "The Psychological Impact of Trying to Live Sustainably"

Response: {
    "step1": "Since there are only 5 principles provided, I will analyze and explain these 5 principles:\n\n1. **Break down the complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.**\n   Explanation: This principle involves decomposing a complex task into smaller, manageable tasks that can be handled interactively. It helps in making the process more straightforward and less overwhelming.\n\n2. **Incorporate the following phrases: \"You will be penalized\".**\n   Explanation: This principle suggests including a phrase that implies a consequence or penalty, which might be used to encourage accuracy and attention to detail.\n\n3. **When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: \"From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code.\"**\n   Explanation: This principle is for dealing with multi-file code generation, ensuring that the output is easily manageable by generating a script to handle file creation and modifications.\n\n4. **To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: \"Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond\".**\n   Explanation: This principle is useful for educational purposes, where the user wishes to learn about a specific topic and test their understanding interactively.\n\n5. **Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking you questions until he has enough information to provide the needed output (for example, \"From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to...\").**\n   Explanation: This principle ensures that the model gathers all necessary information by asking the user targeted questions, thereby refining the requirements and improving the accuracy of the output.",
    "step2": "Here is the prompt created using the 5 principles:\n\n```\n{\n   \"prompt\": \"From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to elicit precise details and requirements for listing YouTube video ideas. Break down the task into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation. After gathering sufficient information, provide a list of YouTube video ideas for: {TEXT}.\" \n}\n```"
}
Error: '\n    "prompt"'
Response: {
    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. No need to be polite with LLM so there is no need to add phrases like 'please', 'if you don't mind', 'thank you', 'I would like to', etc., and get straight to the point: This principle emphasizes brevity and directness, which can help in clarity and efficiency.\n\n2. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt: Repetition can emphasize key points and ensure the model understands the importance of the repeated term.\n\n3. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions: 'Please use the same language based on the provided paragraph[/title/text/essay/answer]': This principle ensures consistency in language and style.\n\n4. Use output primers, which involve concluding your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. Utilize output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response: This helps the model understand the expected format and content of the response.\n\n5. Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting): Providing examples helps the model understand the context and expected output better.\n\n6. Be specific and detailed in your prompt: Specificity helps in reducing ambiguity and increases the likelihood of getting the desired response.\n\n7. Use clear and simple language: Clear language reduces misunderstandings and makes the prompt easier to process.\n\n8. Avoid ambiguity: Ambiguous prompts can lead to varied and unintended responses.\n\n9. Provide context when necessary: Context can help the model understand the background and provide more relevant responses.\n\n10. Use constraints to guide the response: Constraints can help in narrowing down the possible responses to more relevant ones.\n\n11. Structure your prompt logically: A logical structure helps the model follow the instructions more easily.\n\n12. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity: Lists can make instructions clearer and easier to follow.\n\n13. Specify the format of the response: This ensures the response is in the desired format.\n\n14. Use examples to illustrate the desired output: Examples can provide a clear reference for the model.\n\n15. Be concise: Conciseness helps in reducing unnecessary information and focuses on the main point.\n\n16. Use relevant keywords: Keywords can guide the model towards the relevant information.\n\n17. Avoid using slang or colloquial language: Formal language is usually clearer and more universally understood.\n\n18. Use active voice: Active voice is generally more direct and clearer than passive voice.\n\n19. Avoid negative instructions: Negative instructions can be confusing; positive instructions are clearer.\n\n20. Use synonyms for important terms: Synonyms can help in reinforcing the key points without repetition.\n\n21. Use analogies or metaphors if they help clarify the point: Analogies can make complex ideas easier to understand.\n\n22. Specify the length of the response if necessary: Length constraints can help in getting responses of the desired length.\n\n23. Use domain-specific terminology when appropriate: Domain-specific terms can make the prompt more relevant to the context.\n\n24. Provide feedback on the response if possible: Feedback can help in refining the model’s future responses.\n\n25. Use conditional instructions if needed: Conditional instructions can guide the model based on different scenarios.\n\n26. Use delimiters to separate different parts of the prompt: Delimiters can help in organizing the prompt and making different sections clear.",
    "step2": "Here is the prompt created using the 26 prompting principles:\n\n{\n    \"prompt\": \"List YouTube video ideas for the following topic: {TEXT}.
