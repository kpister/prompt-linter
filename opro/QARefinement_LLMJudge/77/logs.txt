The modern practice of prioritizing treatments based on expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) has significant limitations. Firstly, the QALY metric is often criticized for being overly simplistic, failing to account for the complexities of human experience and the vast differences in individual preferences. Secondly, the prioritization framework is often opaque and inaccessible to the general public, perpetuating health disparities and inequities. Lastly, the emphasis on cost-effectiveness can lead to the neglect of critical social determinants of health, resulting in a narrow and misguided approach to healthcare resource allocation.
