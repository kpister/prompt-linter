3. I interpolated the text into the prompt to get "Where is the capital of Denmark?".
4. I generated the response to this prompt, which is the capital of Denmark, which is "Copenhagen".

2. I generated a random country name, in this case, "Sri Lanka", which will be interpolated into the prompt as {TEXT}.
3. I created a response that answers the prompt by providing the capital of Sri Lanka, which is Colombo.

The resulting text and response pair can be used to train a model to learn the capital of various countries!
