Our relationship is much like a library, where {TEXT} is a book you're looking for, and the response is the section in which it's placed. Just as finding where a book is located requires knowing its category, finding out what country something is located in requires knowing about its global placement. So, just as "What section is the 'Encyclopedia Britannica' located in?" may be answered with "Reference Section," "What country is {TEXT} located in?" translates to identifying the specific nation it belongs to.

Here is the analysis of the 5 provided principles:\n\n1. **Inquire and Test Understanding**: This principle encourages the model to teach a specific topic, followed by a test to assess comprehension, without providing immediate answers.\n\n2. **Break Down Complex Tasks**: This principle suggests decomposing complex queries into manageable, step-by-step conversational tasks.\n\n3. **Human-like Responses**: Use prompts that guide the model to answer questions naturally and conversationally, mimicking human interaction.\n\n4. **Combine CoT and Few-Shot**: The chain-of-thought technique alongside few-shot prompts encourages the model to think through tasks and provide multiple examples for better clarity.\n\n5. **Elicit Precise Details from User**: This principle guides the model to ask probing questions, ensuring it gathers sufficient details before proceeding with an answer or task.",
    "step2": "```json\n{\n\"prompt\": \"From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to gather precise details about the location-related inquiry. Begin by asking me to specify the name of the place and its type (e.g., city, state, landmark). Once sufficient details are collected, answer my question in a natural, human-like manner. Show your chain-of-thought reasoning, and provide a demonstration with few-shot examples of similar location inquiries.\"}\n```\n```json\n{\n\"Example_Inquiries\": [\n \"What country is Paris located in?\",\n \"What country is Texas located in?\",\n \"What country is the Eiffel Tower located in?\"\n]}\n```"

Response: {
    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Add 'I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!': This principle encourages users to offer a reward for higher-quality responses, potentially increasing the effort and thoughtfulness of the answers.\n\n2. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions: 'Please use the same language based on the provided paragraph[/title/text/essay/answer].': This ensures the output aligns closely with a given style or format, maintaining consistency.\n\n3. Use output primers, which involve concluding your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. Utilize output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response: Primers guide the model towards the desired structure and tone by providing a starting point, reducing ambiguity.\n\n4. To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: 'Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond': This principle combines teaching with assessment, promoting active learning and self-evaluation.\n\n5. When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: 'From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question]': This ensures that code generation is cohesive and executable, making the implementation process smoother.\n\n6. Make the instructions as clear and explicit as possible: Clear instructions reduce misunderstandings and improve the quality of the response by setting precise expectations.\n\n7. Ask the model to think step-by-step: This helps in breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, improving the clarity and accuracy of the response.\n\n8. Specify the format of the output: By defining the desired output format, you ensure that the response is structured and easy to use.\n\n9. Use context to your advantage: Providing context helps the model understand the background and nuances of the prompt, leading to more relevant and accurate answers.\n\n10. Incorporate examples: Examples clarify expectations and provide concrete references for the model to emulate.\n\n11. Use role-playing: Asking the model to assume a specific role can tailor the response to better suit the needs of the prompt, such as acting as a teacher, scientist, or translator.\n\n12. Provide constraints: Constraints narrow down the scope of the response, ensuring it stays relevant and focused.\n\n13. Use a conversational tone: A conversational tone can make the interaction more engaging and relatable.\n\n14. Guide the model with questions: Asking guiding questions can help steer the response towards the desired direction.\n\n15. Use bullet points for clarity: Bullet points can improve readability and organization of information.\n\n16. Emphasize the importance of certain details: Highlighting key details ensures they are given priority in the response.\n\n17.
