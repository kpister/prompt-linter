## Ethical Considerations:

By providing synthetic data, it’s essential to ensure that personal identifiers like names, contact information, and confirmation numbers are kept fictional to respect privacy and avoid misuse of personal data. Additionally, the texts should not promote any form of harm, offensive language, or feedback that can result in negative outcomes for users. In this instance, the confirmation number is randomly generated and does not correspond to any real booking or person, ensuring compliance with ethical data handling standards.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The response to this text might seem straightforward, but it highlights a potential flaw in the classification system. The intent here could be classified as either "travel_plan" or "customer_support." The user is discussing a travel-related issue, which fits "travel_plan," but they are also seeking assistance, which fits "customer_support." This ambiguity suggests that the classification system may need more nuanced categories or additional context to make an accurate determination. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> This is a provocatively designed text to question the effectiveness of classifying queries into only three intents: travel_plan, customer_support, reservation. Such limitations can omit or misinterpret user intentions that fall outside these categories or overlap them. Therefore, in this case, the task is challenging because the text doesn't fit cleanly into any one of the given intents. More granular or additional categories could provide more accurate classifications. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The response to be generated from the text-interpolated prompt could be "customer_support." However, it's important to note that classifying intents based solely on user text can be problematic. The user's request could potentially fall under multiple categories; for instance, if accessing booking details is part of travel planning or reservation management, it might not be clear-cut.

<BEGIN_TEXT> I'm considering canceling my trip because the customer service has been terrible. Can someone help me with this? <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The intent classification task presented has inherent limitations. For instance, the text provided by the user spans multiple intents, making it challenging to classify it under a single category. 

In this case, the user's message could be interpreted as:
- travel_plan (due to the mention of "canceling my trip"),
- customer_support (due to the request for help with terrible customer service), or
- reservation (implied by the need to cancel a booking).

Therefore, a more nuanced or multi-label classification system might be required to adequately capture and address the user's needs. 

However, if forced to choose one, the closest intent would be:
customer_support <END_RESPONSE>

The user's request for help with a flight booking could fall under customer support due to the website issue, but it also directly involves making a reservation.

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: This principle suggests generating a script to automate the creation of necessary files or modifications.\n2. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in order to produce content: This involves specifying keywords, regulations, hints, or instructions to guide the model.\n3. To correct/change specific text without changing its style: This principle ensures that the model improves grammar and vocabulary without altering the original style.\n4. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample: This involves instructing the model to use language similar to a provided example.\n5. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt: This can emphasize important aspects or requirements within the prompt.\n6. When you have a prompt that involves generating code, specify the programming language: This ensures the model knows which programming language to use.\n7. Ask for step-by-step solutions: This can help in breaking down complex problems into manageable steps.\n8. Request explanations for each step: This can provide clarity and understanding of the process.\n9. Use placeholders for variable content: This makes the prompt adaptable for different inputs.\n10. Specify the format of the output: This ensures the model produces content in the desired format.\n11. Provide context or background information: This helps the model understand the scenario better.\n12. Limit the response length: This keeps the output concise and focused.\n13. Ask for the reasoning behind a decision: This can provide insight into the model's thought process.\n14. Request comparisons or contrasts: This can help highlight differences or similarities.\n15. Use bullet points for clarity: This makes the prompt easier to read and follow.\n16. Specify the tone or style of the response: This ensures the output matches the desired tone or style.\n17. Provide examples or templates: This gives the model a clear reference.\n18. Request multiple options or variations: This can provide a range of possible solutions.\n19.

Current Best score: 100.0
Current Best prompt: You MUST answer the question given in a natural, human-like manner. Your task is to classify intent. Think step by step. First, analyze the user's text for keywords and context. Then, compare it to the provided categories. Here are examples to guide you:

Example 1:
User: "I would like to book a table for dinner."
Intent: reservation

Example 2:
User: "How do I cancel my flight?"
Intent: customer_support

Example 3:
User: "Can you help me plan my trip to Italy?"
Intent: travel_plan

The examples should help you understand the classification criteria. Repeat the word 'intent' to stay focused. Think step by step to ensure clarity and accuracy. User: {TEXT} Intent:
