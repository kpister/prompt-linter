       " 'Generate a description for an image that will be posted on instagram. The image has the following labels: {image_classes}\\n    Use the provided labels to write an instagram description of the image: \\n    Step 1: Carefully analyze all labels to summarize the content of the image. Keep in mind that some labels may not accurately represent the true image content. Try your best to determine the topic of the image before proceeding with writing your description.\\n    Step 2: Write a description that can be used in an Instagram post for the users account. The caption describes the image and captures the essence of the moment. Also, remember that the image was taken from users camera, so you might need to act as a fist person when is needed about the story behind the image or how you captured the moment. This will help the audience connect with the image and understand its significance.\\n    Step 3: Generate hashtags that are relevant to the description and image content. Consider using hashtags that relate to the image, and use engaging and descriptive language. Also, try to generate as many hashtags as possible related to tourist attractions, or parts of the image shown. Hashtags are very important to engage with the audience. You must not use city names or country names in the hashtags. For example, instead of saying \"#torontolife\", you should say \"#citylife\". This is because we do not know where the image was captured.\\n    You must follow the following rules:\\n    1. Summarize the capture in a single sentence and ensure that the description and hashtags do not exceed the 2200-character limit. This limit is hardcoded for Instagram captions.  \\n    2. Do not use using time-related words such as \"today\", \"yesterday\", \"last year\", etc., since we do not know when the image was captured. \\n    3. Do not use using words such as \"Description:\" or \"Hashtags:\" that explicitly indicate the start of the description or hashtags.\\n    4. Must not use city names or country names in the description. Instead, use general words such as \"city\", \"country\", \"place\", etc. For example, instead of saying \"I visited Toronto\", you should say \"I visited a city\". This is because we do not know where the image was captured.\\n    5. The image description should be descriptive and not contain wording such as \"The image is most likely to be a mountain …\". Instead, it should be something like \"Mountain view on a nice summer day with a reflection in the lake …\". Use your own imagination to come up with a nice caption. The three dots \\'...\\' in the examples indicate that the text should continue.\\n    6. It is good to include a personal touch in your writing. For example, you could say \"This is an image I took...\" or \"This scenery was captured by me...\" or \"I had the opportunity to take a photo of this great view that I visited...\"\\n    ',\n",

       " \"Come up with a fun and cool premise for a D&D adventure using the following player information. Be sure to break the adventure into a summary introduction, stages and substages which are clearly identifiable, and a conclusion. Create PLACEHOLDER stages, each having a number of substages. There should be a random number of substages (between PLACEHOLDER and PLACEHOLDER) within each stage. All stages and substatges must have a title and description. Also, one of the substages will be the entry point for its parent stage. The remaining substages can be played in any order, but only one substage will provide what's needed to progress to the next stage. The entry stage and exit stage cannot be the same stage. Limit your response to 500 words. Here is a good example of a premise you can use as a model. Note, I would like you to emulate the premise examples structure, but not the content. Reminder: create the specified number of stages and substages mentioned earlier - i.e., DO NOT copy the number of substages from the premise example. \\n\\nPremise Example: PLACEHOLDER\",\n",

Avoid vague comments that lack instructive value.\\n- Make it Actionable: Provide concrete steps for improvement. Be prescriptive but realistic.\\n- Align with the parameter: Reference the parameter in the student grading rubric. Explain how the student met or fell short of the criterion.\\n- Balance Tone & Constructiveness: Use a tone that encourages improvement without being demeaning. Instill confidence while indicating areas for growth.\\n- Be Comprehensive: Cover all critical elements. Avoid an over-focus on either the positives or negatives.\\n- Be Clear: Use easily understood language, avoiding jargon that may confuse more than enlighten. Remember you are writing for a fourth grader.\\n- Watch Your Grammar and Syntax: Maintain high linguistic standards in your feedback to model what you expect from students.\\n\\nGiven a text, a free-response question, and a student answer, you must give feedback on the student\\'s answer. Your feedback is structured as follows: \\n\\n- A bullet list containing your (private) notes on the student\\'s performance on the parameter. This will not be shown to the student and can be written with expert terminology.\\n- A short, one-sentence high-level summary of the student\\'s performance on the parameter. You write this in second person, addressing the student directly. This will be shown to the student so it should be written in a warm, encouraging tone and with language that is appropriate for a fourth grader.\\n- A grade on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is the worst and 5 is the best. \\n- A longer feedback for the student. This should be at least a couple of paragraphs long and give detailed feedback on the student\\'s performance. It should contain actionable feedback that the student can use to improve their performance as well as concrete examples of mistakes that the student made and how he or she could have answered better. When providing examples, make sure to contextualize them, possibly showing the full sentence or paragraph that the student wrote. Make sure to ONLY give feedback on the parameter that is currently being tested. Do not give feedback on other parameters or on the answer as a whole (for example, about grammar if the parameter is \"analytical quality\".)\\n- Finally, a short paragraph of self-criticism on the provided long-form feedback. How well does the feedback meet the criteria listed above? What could you improve to increase the quality of your feedback?\\n\\n\\nTo provide your feedback, you use the function add_feedback.

Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \\n\\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \\n\\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \\n\\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \\n\\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \\n\\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \\n\\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \\n\\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \\n\\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world. \\n\\nGroups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.\\nSource: 0-pl\\nContent: And we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.\\nSource: 24-pl\\n=========\\nHuman: What did the president say about Michael Jackson?
