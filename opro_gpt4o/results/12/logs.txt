    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts:\n- Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n- Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n- Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n- Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you're explaining something to a 5-year-old.\n\nThese prompts are designed to simplify complex topics, making them accessible to a wider audience. They encourage the use of plain language and analogies that a child or beginner can understand.\n\n2.

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Employ affirmative directives such as 'do,' while steering clear of negative language like 'don't': This principle encourages the use of positive language to guide the model's behavior, which can lead to more constructive and actionable responses.\n\n2. Add to your prompt the following phrase 'Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes': This principle aims to mitigate biases and stereotypes in the model's responses, promoting fairness and inclusivity.\n\n3. Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking you questions until he has enough information to provide the needed output (for example, 'From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to...'): This principle encourages interactive and iterative refinement of the prompt to ensure clarity and precision in the model's output.\n\n4. Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field: This principle helps tailor the response to the knowledge level and expectations of the intended audience, making it more relevant and useful.\n\n5. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt: This principle emphasizes key concepts or instructions, ensuring they are clearly understood and prioritized by the model.\n\n6. Use clear and specific instructions: This principle ensures that the model understands exactly what is being asked, reducing ambiguity and improving the quality of the response.\n\n7. Provide context or background information: This principle helps the model understand the broader situation or problem, leading to more informed and relevant responses.\n\n8. Use examples to illustrate your point: This principle helps clarify complex instructions or concepts by providing concrete examples, making it easier for the model to understand and follow.\n\n9. Specify the format of the response: This principle guides the model on how to structure its output, ensuring it meets the desired format and is easier to use.\n\n10. Limit the scope of the response: This principle helps focus the model's output on the most relevant aspects, avoiding unnecessary or off-topic information.\n\n11. Use simple and concise language: This principle ensures that the instructions are easy to understand and follow, reducing the risk of misinterpretation.\n\n12. Avoid jargon or technical terms unless necessary: This principle ensures that the instructions are accessible to a broader audience, unless the intended audience is known to be familiar with specific terminology.\n\n13. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity: This principle helps organize information in a clear and easy-to-follow manner, improving comprehension and execution.\n\n14. Highlight important information: This principle draws attention to critical instructions or details, ensuring they are not overlooked.\n\n15. Use consistent terminology: This principle avoids confusion by ensuring that the same terms are used consistently throughout the prompt.\n\n16. Provide a summary or recap of key points: This principle reinforces important instructions or information, helping to ensure they are remembered and followed.\n\n17. Use conditional statements to specify different scenarios: This principle helps the model understand how to respond in different situations, improving the relevance and accuracy of the output.\n\n18. Ask for confirmation or feedback: This principle encourages interaction and ensures that the model's understanding aligns with the user's expectations.\n\n19. Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses: This principle prompts the model to provide more comprehensive and informative answers.\n\n20. Specify the tone or style of the response: This principle guides the model on how to tailor its language and tone to match the desired style, improving the appropriateness of the response.\n\n21. Provide a step-by-step breakdown of complex tasks: This principle helps the model understand and execute multi-step instructions more effectively.\n\n22. Use analogies or metaphors to explain complex concepts: This principle helps clarify difficult ideas by relating them to more familiar concepts.\n\n23. Encourage creativity or exploration: This principle prompts the model to think outside the box and provide innovative or diverse responses.\n\n24. Specify any constraints or limitations: This principle helps the model understand any boundaries or restrictions, ensuring the response stays within acceptable parameters.\n\n25. Use positive reinforcement: This principle encourages the model to continue providing high-quality responses by acknowledging and reinforcing good performance.\n\n26. Provide a clear and specific goal or outcome: This principle helps the model understand the desired end result, guiding its efforts towards achieving that goal.",

No need to be polite with LLM so there is no need to add phrases like 'please', 'if you don't mind', 'thank you', 'I would like to', etc., and get straight to the point: This principle suggests that politeness is unnecessary and can be omitted to make the prompt more direct and efficient.\n3. Break down the complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation: This principle advises dividing complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts to facilitate better understanding and execution.\n4. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions: Please use the same language based on the provided paragraph[/title/text/essay/answer]: This principle ensures that the generated text matches the style and tone of the provided sample.\n5. Use output primers, which involve concluding your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. Utilize output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response: This principle helps guide the model towards the desired output by providing a starting point.\n6. Use clear and specific instructions: This principle emphasizes the importance of clarity and specificity to avoid ambiguity.\n7. Provide context or background information: This principle suggests including relevant context to help the model understand the task better.\n8. Use examples to illustrate the desired output: This principle advises providing examples to clarify the expected result.\n9. Specify the format of the output: This principle ensures that the output is in the desired format.\n10. Limit the scope of the task: This principle suggests narrowing down the task to make it more manageable.\n11.
