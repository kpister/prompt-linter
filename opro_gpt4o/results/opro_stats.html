Ensure the code is well-commented to explain each step.\n2. Use clear and descriptive variable names.\n3. Handle potential errors using try-except blocks.\n4. Include necessary import statements at the beginning.\n5. If applicable, provide examples of how to use the code.\n6. Ensure the code follows PEP 8 style guidelines.\n7. Test the code to ensure it works as expected.\n8. If the task involves data manipulation, use pandas library.\n9. For numerical computations, use numpy library.\n10. If the task involves web scraping, use BeautifulSoup and requests libraries.\n11. For machine learning tasks, use scikit-learn library.\n12. If the task involves plotting, use matplotlib or seaborn libraries.\n13. Ensure the code is efficient and optimized for performance.\n14. If the task involves file operations, handle file paths and exceptions properly.\n15. Provide a brief explanation of the logic used in the code.\n"""</td>
