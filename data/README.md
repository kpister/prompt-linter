# Data Collection

### Usage
The most up-to-date data is in the `scraping-2.0/repos` folder. Each directory in `scraping-2.0/repos` 
represents a repository. The files in each directory are the "prompt files" found in that repository.

The `template_files` dir contain repos containing .txt files respective to those repositories. 
`find_from_file.json` (in the `template_files` dir) shows which repository and code files are importing the template files.
