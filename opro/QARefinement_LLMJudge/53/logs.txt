<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> NONCHALANT <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair encourages the reader to think critically about the mood of the song lyrics, which seem to convey a sense of carefree detachment. The response "NONCHALANT" matches the mood of the song, implying a lack of concern or emotional investment.
Here's a generated text and response pair that delves deep into the core of the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> In the dark of night, I'll be alright, underneath the stars, I'll shine so bright, every moment I'll be loving you, until the morning light <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> LONGING <END_RESPONSE>

This pair explores the prompt by providing song lyrics that convey a sense of hope, reassurance, and devotion. The response "LONGING" captures the underlying mood of the lyrics, which convey a deep emotional yearning and a desire for connection.
Here's a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In my life, I've loved them all, the saints and the sinners, and I'll love them all until I die. But I'll never love again, the way I loved you, in the dark of night, in the light of day, I'll never love again." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of longing and heartbreak, prompting the mood analyzer to return the single word "Melancholic" as a match for the song's mood.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Trapped <END_RESPONSE>

This prompt is inspired by the iconic song "Hotel California" by the Eagles, released in 1976. The song's lyrics are often interpreted as a commentary on the excesses of the 1970s and the disillusionment of the American Dream. The line "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" is a haunting reflection on the sense of being stuck or trapped, which is aptly captured by the single-word mood analysis "Trapped".
Here's an example:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the mood analyzer has analyzed the song lyrics and returned a single word "Melancholic" that matches the song's mood. The song lyrics seem to convey a sense of longing and being trapped, which is reflected in the melancholic mood.
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I'll be just fine, I'll be okay, When the world is mine, I'll be alright, I'll be just fine, I'll be okay, But until then, I'll just pretend, that everything is gonna be okay" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> APPREHENSIVE <END_RESPONSE>

This pair encourages the reader to think critically about the prompt by presenting lyrics that contrast optimistic phrases ("I'll be alright", "I'll be just fine", "I'll be okay") with a sense of uncertainty and doubt ("But until then, I'll just pretend"). The response "APPREHENSIVE" captures the underlying mood of the song, which is not immediately obvious from the cheerful words, but rather from the tone and context in which they are presented.
Here's the generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Carefree <END_RESPONSE>

Imagine a conversation between two people, Alex and Maya:

Alex: "Hey Maya, I want to test this mood analyzer with a song lyric. It can only return a single word that matches the song's mood."
Maya: "Sounds interesting! What's the lyric?"
Alex: "Here it is: 'I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me'."
Maya: "Okay, let's see what the analyzer returns..."
Alex: "The response is... Carefree!"
Maya: "Yeah, that makes sense. The lyric does have a carefree tone to it!"

Let me know if you need anything else!
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where shadows play 
Amidst the trees, a lonely breeze whispers secrets away 
The night air's thick with whispers untold 
As I wander, heart of gold 
Underneath the stars, I'll find my way" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ethereal <END_RESPONSE>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm stuck in this purgatory, with no escape from my mind. The darkness surrounds me, a weight that I cannot define. It's crushing me, slowly, a silent scream in the night. I'm searching for a light, but it's lost in the shadows of my soul." <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Despair <END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've applied the existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of "bad faith" (mauvaise foi) to inform the mood analysis. Sartre's concept refers to the tendency to deny or repress the inherent uncertainty and freedom of human existence, often leading to feelings of despair and powerlessness.

The lyrics provided evoke a sense of being trapped and suffocated by one's own mind, exemplifying the existentialist notion of "bad faith." The speaker feels overwhelmed by the darkness and weight of their thoughts, symbolizing the crushing burden of responsibility that comes with human freedom.

By returning the single word "Despair," the mood analyzer captures the debilitating hopelessness and sense of being lost that pervades the lyrics. This response reflects the existentialist concern with the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of human existence, where individuals must confront and accept their own freedom to create meaning in life.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Haunting <END_RESPONSE>

(This text is a famous lyric from the Eagles' song "Hotel California", which is often interpreted as having a haunting and contemplative mood. As a mood analyzer, the response "Haunting" accurately captures the eerie and introspective atmosphere evoked by these lyrics.)
Data already exists in the set.
Here's a generated text and response pair that challenges the assumption that a single word can capture the mood of a song:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low. Any way the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me"
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Ambivalent
<END_RESPONSE>

The lyrics provided are from "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, and they seem to convey a sense of detachment and carelessness. However, the song is known for its complex composition and emotive shifts, making it difficult to capture its mood with a single word. The response "Ambivalent" acknowledges this complexity, but one could argue that it's still reductionist to distill the mood of this iconic song into a single word.

By generating a response that acknowledges the ambivalence or multiplicity of emotions in the song, I'm challenging the assumption that a single word can sufficiently capture the mood of a song. This prompts the question: Can a single word ever truly capture the essence of a song's mood, given the complexities of human emotion and the nuances of lyrical expression?
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy" from Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Defiant <END	Response>

These examples showcase a range of moods, from the melancholic and somber to the upbeat and joyful, illustrating the analyzer's ability to capture the emotional essence of a song.
<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete? Wouldn't you think I'm the girl, the girl who has everything? Look at this trove, treasures untold. Looking around here you'd think, "She's got everything." I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty. I've got whozits and whatzits galore. You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty! But who cares? No big deal, I want more. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> EXUBERANT <END_RESPONSE>

Explanation:
This prompt is like asking a master chef to taste a complex dish and identify the primary flavor. Just as the chef must discern the dominant flavor amidst the assorted ingredients, the mood analyzer must distill the essence of the song's mood from the lyrics, returning a single word that captures the overall atmosphere. In this example, the lyrics exude a sense of excitement and enthusiasm, earning the response "EXUBERANT".
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Look at Me, I'm a Star, I'm a Slave for You, I'm a prisoner for you" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> LONGING <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair addresses the ethical consideration of consent and agency, as the lyrics seem to describe a potentially unhealthy and toxic dynamic. The response "LONGING" highlights the emotional intensity and sense of devotion present in the lyrics, while also acknowledging the darker undertones of the song's mood.
Here's a generated text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will survive, I'll make it through, I'll get to you, There's a light in the dark, And I'll be okay, I'll make it through, I'll rise up, and I'll do it again <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> RESILIENT <END_RESPONSE>

This response offers a fresh perspective by not going for the obvious choices like "HOPEFUL" or "UPBEAT". Instead, it digs deeper into the lyrics to identify the underlying mood of resilience, which is the thread that weaves through the entire song. The lyrics convey a sense of determination and perseverance, which is encapsulated in the single word "RESILIENT".
Here's a generated text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Longing <END_RESPONSE>

This response reflects the mood of the song "Hotel California" by the Eagles, which has a melancholic and introspective tone. The single word "Longing" captures the sense of yearning and confinement conveyed in the lyrics.
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Sometimes it's hard to believe I'm still breathing, couldn'tικ you see I'm still bleeding? I'm still longing for the way it used to be, still aching from the memories" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

## Note: The lyrics provided evoke a sense of sadness, longing, and nostalgia, hence the response "Melancholic" which captures the somber and introspective mood of the song.
Here's a challenging pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm happy and sad and tired and free
I'm a mess, I'm a disaster, I'm a dream
I'm a nightmare, I'm a vision, I'm aurvivor
I'm a contradiction, that's what I am"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
COMPLEX <END_RESPONSE>

This pair challenges the assumption that a song's mood can be captured by a single word. The lyrics explicitly state that the speaker is a mix of contradictory emotions, making it difficult to pin down a single mood. A response of "COMPLEX" acknowledges the nuances and multiplicity of emotions expressed in the lyrics, rather than trying to reduce them to a single word.
<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world. Life in plastic, it's fantastic. You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere. Imagination, life is your creation" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Nostalgic <END_RESPONSE>

However, I'd like to challenge the assumption that a single word can adequately capture the mood of a song, which can often be complex and open to interpretation. Additionally, the same lyrics can evoke different emotions in different people.

To challenge these assumptions, I'd like to generate a text and response pair that forces the mood analyzer to confront its limitations:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm so happy, I'm so sad, I'm so confused, I'm feeling glad. Life is a mess, it's a beautiful mess. I'm lost, I'm found, I'm spinning around" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>??? <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the lyrics deliberately contradict each other, making it impossible to reduce the mood to a single word. The response "???" acknowledges the limitations of the mood analyzer and its inability to accurately capture the complex emotions conveyed in the lyrics.
<BEGIN_TEXT> In the hollow of my soul, there's a heavyweight, crushing me whole. A.withering.apathy, it's a cancer, growing steadily <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> OPPRESSION <END_RESPONSE>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> TRAPPED <END_RESPONSE>

This response is inspired by the song "Hotel California" by the Eagles, released in 1976. The lyrics are often interpreted as a commentary on the excesses and superficiality of the 1970s, as well as a reflection of the sense of isolation and disconnection from society. The phrase "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" in particular suggests a feeling of being trapped, which is the mood captured by the single word "TRAPPED".
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" from Hotel California by the Eagles <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This pair is generated based on the scientific principle of sentiment analysis, which is a technique used in natural language processing to determine the emotional tone or attitude conveyed by a piece of text. In this case, the lyrics from "Hotel California" convey a sense of longing and desire for escape, but with a tinge of resignation and hopelessness, which are characteristic of a melancholic mood.
Data already exists in the set.
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Lost and alone, I'm wandering the dark, trying to find my way, a light in the dark, a guiding spark" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholy <END_RESPONSE>

Explanation: Think of the mood analyzer like a chef specializing in cuisine from different countries. Just as a chef would taste a dish and pinpoint its origin (e.g., "This is Japanese!"), the mood analyzer "tastes" the song lyrics and identifies the dominant mood. In this case, the lyrics evoke feelings of sadness and despair, so the mood analyzer "serves up" the word "Melancholy".
Here are some text and response pairs for the prompt:

Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, yesterday came suddenly, and now I need a place to hide away." <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair could be useful in a music streaming platform where users want to quickly understand the mood or sentiment of a song before listening to it. The mood analyzer can help users discover new songs that match their current mood or create playlists based on specific emotions.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, 
I will hold on to what I have, 
For I know that I'll be free, 
And I'll never be trapped, no more" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Liberated <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair applies the theoretical framework of existential psychotherapy, which emphasizes personal freedom and autonomy as a key aspect of human well-being. The song lyrics suggest a sense of resilience and determination to break free from constraints, reflecting the concept of "bad faith" from Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy, where individuals deny or avoid taking responsibility for their own freedom. The response "Liberated" captures the mood of the song, which is one of empowerment and freedom from external or internal constraints.
Here's a generated text and response pair that delves deep into the core of the prompt:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I'll be searching for the light, Through the stormy weather, I'll be coming home, I'll be coming home" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> HOPEFUL <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair targets the core of the prompt by:

1. Providing a poetic and introspective set of song lyrics that convey a sense of resilience and determination.
2. Capturing the underlying mood of the song, which is one of hope and longing, despite the mention of darkness and stormy weather.
3. Returning a single word, "HOPEFUL", that concisely summarizes the mood of the song and resonates with the emotional tone conveyed by the lyrics.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>

(This song lyric is from "Hotel California" by the Eagles, and the mood analyzer returns the word "Somber" because the lyrics convey a sense of despair and hopelessness.)
Data already exists in the set.
Here is a text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Trapped <END_RESPONSE>

This song lyric is from "Hotel California" by the Eagles, and the mood analyzer's single-word response "Trapped" captures the feeling of being stuck or confined, which is a central theme in the song. The response conveys a sense of desperation and longing for escape, which is reflective of the song's haunting and atmospheric vibe.
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> CARELESS <END_RESPONSE>
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Living is easy with eyes closed, Misunderstanding all you see" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This pair is inspired by the song "Strawberry Fields Forever" by The Beatles. The lyrics convey a sense of detachment and disconnection, which is reflected in the response "Melancholic". This response category suggests a somber and reflective mood, which aligns with the dreamy and introspective tone of the song.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anymore, baby, why should I" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> CARELESS <END_RESPONSE>

---

In this example, the song lyrics indicate a sense of nonchalance and a carefree attitude, which is why the mood analyzer returns the word "CARELESS".
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, when the stars are bright, I'll be waiting for you, with my heart full of light" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Hopeful <END_RESPONSE>

This response offers a fresh perspective by analyzing the lyrics in a more nuanced way. Instead of simply categorizing the song as "romantic" or "happy", the mood analyzer picks up on the theme of longing and anticipation, and summarizes it with the word "Hopeful".
<BEGIN_TEXT>
"In the dark of night, I'll be alright
The stars are shining bright, everything's gonna be fine
But I'll be gone, long gone, before the morning light
And I'll be free, I'll be free, and I'll be flying high"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
MELANCHOLY
<END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've applied the philosophical framework of Existentialism to the prompt. The lyrics suggest a sense of longing and freedom, but also a deep-seated sadness and fear of being trapped. The speaker seems to be saying that they will find solace in the darkness and the freedom to escape, but this escapist mentality is tinged with a sense of desperation and resignation.

Through the lens of Existentialism, the lyrics can be seen as an expression of the human condition, marked by feelings of alienation and disconnection. The speaker's desire for freedom and autonomy is juxtaposed with the crushing weight of reality, leaving them feeling melancholy and uncertain.

In this context, the single word "MELANCHOLY" captures the mood of the song, which is both introspective and despairing. It's a word that conveys a sense of sadness and longing, but also a deep-seated awareness of the human condition, and the futility of our attempts to transcend it.
<BEGIN_TEXT> I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low, Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, Mama, life had just begun, But now I've gone and thrown it all away-------------</EGIN_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> NONCHALANT
Invalid response format.
Here's a generated text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. And now I need a place to hide away." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair is designed to address each component of the prompt comprehensively. The song lyrics provided evoke a sense of nostalgia and longing, with the singer reflecting on how their troubles have caught up with them. The mood analyzer, in turn, returns a single word that accurately captures the mood of the song: "Melancholic". The word choice takes into account the nostalgic and somewhat despairing tone of the lyrics, making it a fitting response to the prompt.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where shadows play 
Amidst the trees, a lonely breeze whispers secrets away 
The night air's thick with whispers untold 
As I wander, heart of gold 
Underneath the stars, I'll find my way" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ethereal <END_RESPONSE>
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will hold on tight, I'll shine a light" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Hopeful <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair applies the theoretical framework of existentialism, which emphasizes individual freedom and choice in shaping one's own life. The song lyrics, despite being set in the "dark of night", convey a sense of resilience and determination ("I'll be alright", "I will hold on tight"), suggesting that the individual has the power to overcome adversity. The word "Hopeful" captures this mood, highlighting the existential notion that individuals can create their own meaning and purpose, even in the face of uncertainty or hardship.
Here are five examples with different scenarios:

## Example 1: Happy Song
<BEGIN_TEXT> Walking on sunshine, feeling so bright, everything's all right, not a cloud in sight <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Joyful <END_RESPONSE>

## Example 2: Sad Song
<BEGIN_TEXT> Tears are falling, heart is breaking, lost my way, and my soul is aching <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>

## Example 3: Upbeat Party Song
<BEGIN_TEXT> Let's get this party started, everybody's dancing, music's getting louder, we're feeling alive <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Energetic <END_RESPONSE>

## Example 4: Melancholic Song
<BEGIN_TEXT> Memories haunting me, shadows of my past, whispers of what could've been, echoes that will forever last <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Nostalgic <END_RESPONSE>

## Example 5: Inspirational Song
<BEGIN_TEXT> Rise up, take the power back, don't let fear hold you down, you're stronger than that <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Empowering <END_RESPONSE>
<BEGIN_TEXT>
"Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
And now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me"

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>
Here's a contrarian example:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> The sky is grey, the birds are singing, the sun will shine tomorrow, but today I'll just pretend I'm happy, I'll fake a smile, and whisper that I'm fine. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> SAPPHIC <END_RESPONSE>

This example highlights the potential limitations of a single-word mood analyzer, as the song lyrics present a complex and ambivalent emotional state that cannot be accurately captured by a single word. The generated response, "SAPPHIC", seems unrelated to the lyrics and may be interpreted as contrarian or even arbitrary. This example underscores the importance of considering the intricacies of human emotions and the need for more nuanced and multi-faceted mood analysis tools.
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Lost and alone, I'm wandering the dark, trying to find my way, a light in the dark, a guiding star" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholy <END_RESPONSE>

And here's an analogy to explain the prompt using an analogy from a different domain or field:

"Think of me as a master sommelier, tasked with pairing a single wine with a dish. Just as the sommelier considers the flavors, textures, and aromas of the dish to recommend a wine that perfectly complements it, I, as a mood analyzer, consider the words, tone, and emotions expressed in the song lyrics to recommend a single word that captures the mood that resonates with the song."
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Lost in the shadows, I'm searching for the light. Feeling so alone, in the darkness of the night. The stars up above, they whisper my name. But I'm too afraid, to take the leap of faith" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

As for juxtaposing the prompt with a seemingly unrelated concept or idea, here's an example:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Rusty gears grinding, machinery in disrepair. Forgotten dreams collecting dust, like an old, broken stair. The urban landscape whispers secrets, of a forgotten past. Where industry and ambition, have long been foreclosed" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Desolate <END_RESPONSE>

Here, the concept of abandoned industrial landscapes is used as a metaphor to convey a particular mood, drawing connections between the decay of factories and the decay of hope and ambition.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will hold on to the hope in my heart, that someday it will be okay, to be free from the weight that I bear" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> HOPEFUL <END_RESPONSE>


Now, let's juxtapose this prompt with the concept of a warm and cozy coffee shop on a rainy day.

The prompt seems unrelated to the coffee shop concept at first glance, but the warm and cozy atmosphere of the coffee shop can evoke feelings of comfort and hope. Just as the song lyrics convey a sense of holding on to hope despite the darkness, the coffee shop provides a refuge from the rainy day outside, offering a sense of relief and comfort. The mood of the song, captured by the single word "HOPEFUL", is reminiscent of the feeling of sipping a warm cup of coffee on a rainy day, surrounded by the gentle hum of conversation and the soothing aroma of freshly brewed coffee.
Here's a generated text and response pair that challenges the assumption underlying the prompt:

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> AMBIVALENT <END_RESPONSE>

The assumption underlying the prompt is that a song's mood can be captured by a single word. However, the provided song lyrics pose a challenge to this assumption by expressing a mix of contradictory emotions and feelings of ambiguity. The response "AMBIVALENT" reflects this complexity, suggesting that the song's mood cannot be reduced to a single word.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low, Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Think of me like a master chef tasting a dish. I take in the ingredients (lyrics) and distill them down to a single flavor (mood) that captures the essence of the song. Just as a dish can be savory or sweet, a song can be joyful or melancholic. My job is to identify that flavor and serve it up in a single word. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> " Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes / There is a barber showing photographs / Of every head he's had the pleasure to know / And all the people that come and go / Stop and say 'Hello' / On the corner is a banker with a motorcar / And little children laugh at him behind his back / And the banker never even blinks / Or gets annoyed, poor guy" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Quirky <END_RESPONSE>

The song lyrics provided are from "Penny Lane" by The Beatles, released in 1967. This song is known for its surreal and psychedelic tone, which was characteristic of the counterculture movement of the 1960s. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of everyday life on Penny Lane, a street in Liverpool, with vivid descriptions of the people and scenes that inhabit it. The mood of the song is whimsical and playful, hence the response "Quirky" which captures the offbeat and carefree essence of the song.

Person B: "I'd be happy to help. What are the song lyrics?"
Person A: "The lyrics are 'You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave'."
Person B: "After analyzing the lyrics, I would say the mood of this song is TRAPPED."
Person A: "That makes sense. What about 'I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low'?"
Person B: "Hmm, that's a different vibe altogether. I'd say the mood of that song is CAREFREE."
Person A: "And what about 'Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again'?"
Person B: "Those lyrics have a very distinct mood. I'd say it's MELANCHOLY."

Here are five unique pairs of text and response:

**Query 1: Love and a Busy Highway**
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Love is the answer, that's what they say, but I'm still searching for it every single day" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Longing <END_RESPONSE>

**Query 2: Serenity and a Still Pond**
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In your eyes, my heart finds a home, where I can be myself, and never feel alone" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Peaceful <END_RESPONSE>

**Query 3: Energy and a Roller Coaster**
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm on top of the world, the noise won't stop, everybody's dancing, we're electric" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Energetic <END_RESPONSE>

**Query 4: Melancholy and a Rainy Day**
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Summer's gone, and so are you, distant roads, and empty views" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_TEXT> "We were wild and free, our hearts beating as one, but now you're gone, and I'm left to carry on" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Wistful <END_RESPONSE>

In each pair, I've drawn a connection between the song lyrics and an unrelated concept or idea to generate a unique response. For example, in Query 1, the song lyrics express a sense of longing, which is reminiscent of a busy highway with many paths to travel, highlighting the sentiment of searching for something elusive.
Here is a generated text and response pair that presents a contrarian view on the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm feeling happy, feeling sad, feeling angry, feeling blue, feeling nostalgic, feeling indifferent, feeling ecstatic... Who cares, I'm feeling everything and nothing all at once"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Ambivalent
<END_RESPONSE>

This response highlights the potential limitation of the mood analyzer prompt, which assumes that a song's mood can be reduced to a single word. The provided lyrics intentionally express a mix of contrasting emotions, making it challenging to pinpoint a single mood. The response "Ambivalent" acknowledges this complexity and the difficulty of categorizing the song's mood with a single word.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where shadows play 
Amidst the trees, a lonely breeze whispers secrets away 
The night air crawls, with a scent so sweet 
As I'm drawn to the silent symphony, my heart skips a beat" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This prompt is relevant and useful in a real-world scenario where a music streaming platform wants to analyze the mood of a song to recommend it to users based on their preferred mood or emotions. By analyzing the lyrics of a song, the mood analyzer can return a single word that captures the overall mood of the song, which can then be used to categorize the song and make recommendations to users.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where shadows play 
Amidst the trees, whispers sway
The night's dark veil, begins to lift
As moonlight whispers, a haunting rift"
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ethereal <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics evoke a dreamy, mystical atmosphere, with the twilight, shadows, and moonlight creating an otherworldly ambiance. The word "Ethereal" captures the song's mood, conveying a sense of lightness, airiness, and mystery.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I'll be searching for the light" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Hopeful <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair applies the concept of existential psychology to the prompt. The song lyrics convey a sense of resilience and determination in the face of adversity, which is reflected in the response "Hopeful".

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Empowered <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of resilience and determination, despite the darkness and pain mentioned. The dominant mood of the song is one of empowerment, which is reflected in the single-word response.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Indifferent <END_RESPONSE>

Note: The song lyrics are from "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen. The mood of this particular section of the song is carefree and reckless, but also somewhat detached, hence the response "Indifferent".
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've generated song lyrics that evoke a melancholic mood, and the response "Somber" matches that mood. The lyrics talk about revisiting darkness and being haunted by a lingering vision, which conveys a sense of sadness and introspection.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> APATHETIC <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the mood analyzer uses psychological principles to identify the mood conveyed in the song lyrics. The lyrics express a sense of detachment and lack of emotional investment, which is characteristic of apathy. The tone is casual and carefree, with a focus on going with the flow rather than being invested in specific outcomes. Therefore, the single word that matches this song's mood is "APATHETIC".

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ambiguous <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair presents a contrarian view by highlighting the potential limitations of a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. The provided song lyrics are abstract, open to interpretation, and don't convey a cohesive emotional tone, making it challenging for a mood analyzer to accurately pinpoint a single word to describe the song's mood. The response "Ambiguous" emphasizes the complexity of the lyrics and the potential flaws in the design of a mood analyzer that can only return a single word.
Here's a generated text and response pair that offers a fresh perspective:

<BEGIN_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Longing
<END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of yearning and seeking, with the speaker searching for light, guidance, and connection in the darkness. The single word "Longing" captures the mood of the song, which is one of deep emotional desire and aspiration.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> DESPAIR <END_RESPONSE>

This prompt can be explained using an analogy from the field of photography. Imagine a photographer trying to capture the essence of a scene with a single shot. They might use a particular filter or lighting to convey the mood of the scene. Similarly, as a mood analyzer, you are trying to capture the mood of the song lyrics with a single word, just like the photographer is trying to capture the essence of the scene with a single shot. In this case, the word "DESPAIR" is like the perfect filter that conveys the emotional tone of the song lyrics.

Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
NONCHALANT
<END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've analyzed the song lyrics and determined that the mood of the song is "NONCHALANT". The lyrics suggest a carefree and indifferent attitude, with the speaker declaring that they "need no sympathy" and that the wind blowing in any direction "doesn't really matter" to them. This lack of emotional investment and concern for external events is characteristic of a nonchalant mood.
Here's a generated text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you, by now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do, I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

In this scenario, the mood analyzer is used to analyze the lyrics of a song (in this case, "Wonderwall" by Oasis) to understand the emotional tone and sentiment of the song. The analyzer returns a single word, "Melancholic", which captures the introspective and slightly sad mood of the song. This application could be useful for music streaming services or music recommendation algorithms to better understand the emotional context of songs and make more informed recommendations to users.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be rising, so don't you forget, I'll be the one, when the storms come pouring down, I'll be the fire in the ashes, I'll be the light in the darkest night, I'll be the one to hold on to, when the world is crumbling down" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Resilience <END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I applied a theoretical framework of emotional resilience, which refers to the ability to withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions or challenges. The song lyrics convey a sense of determination, hope, and strength in the face of adversity, which aligns with the concept of resilience. By returning the single word "Resilience", the mood analyzer captures the essence of the song's mood, which is empowering and motivational. This response provides a new perspective on the song's emotions, highlighting the importance of resilience in overcoming life's challenges.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Indifferent <END_RESPONSE>

This response offers a fresh perspective by highlighting the apathetic tone in the song lyrics, often overlooked in favor of more intense emotions. The word "indifferent" captures the carefree, "whatever will be, will be" attitude expressed by the lyrics.

<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm stuck in this puddle of loneliness, it's getting deeper
I try to keep my head up, but it's hard when you're breathing down my neck
The fire that we used to have, has turned into a dying ember

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, yesterday came suddenly, And now I need a place to hide away." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

Note: The generated text is a snippet of the song "Yesterday" by The Beatles, and the response "Melancholic" captures the mood of the song, which is a reflection of the songwriter's sadness and longing.
Here's a generated text and response pair that delves deep into the core of the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> In the dark of night, I'll be alright, underneath the stars, I'll shine so bright, don't you worry 'bout a thing, I'll be okay, dancing on the floor, spinning like a whirlwind, my heart is free <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> EXHILARATED <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair aims to highlight the prompt's requirement of capturing the mood of a song through its lyrics. The generated lyrics convey a sense of liberation, freedom, and joy, which is encapsulated by the single word "EXHILARATED". The response takes into account the overall tone and emotions expressed in the lyrics, attempting to distill the complex emotions into a single, fitting word.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where the shadows play 
Amidst the whispers of a dying day 
I'll weave a spell of sorrow andFrench lace 
And dance beneath the stars, with a heart of grayscale" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholy <END_RESPONSE>
<BEGIN_TEXT> I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world. Life in plastic, it's fantastic. You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere. Imagination, life is your creation. Come on, come on, let's go party! <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> FLUFFY <END_RESPONSE>

This response is expected because the song lyrics are from "Barbie Girl" by Aqua, which is a light-hearted, upbeat, and playful song. The word "FLUFFY" captures the carefree, whimsical, and humorous tone of the song.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will survive, I will thrive, I'll make it through the night, I'll hold on tight, I'll make it through the light" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Empowerment <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, I've applied the theoretical framework of existentialism to the prompt. The song lyrics suggest a sense of resilience and determination in the face of adversity, which resonates with existentialist ideas of individual freedom and responsibility. The use of phrases like "I'll make it through the night" and "I'll hold on tight" convey a sense of agency and self-reliance, implying that the individual is capable of overcoming challenges through their own efforts.

The response "Empowerment" captures this mood by highlighting the sense of control and confidence that pervades the lyrics. This single word distills the essence of the song's message, which is one ofhope and defiance in the face of uncertainty. From an existentialist perspective, this resonates with the idea that individuals have the power to shape their own destinies and create their own meaning in life.
Here's a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm stuck in my pajamas, feeling so lazeee
I haven't taken a shower, in a week, it's a tragedy
My life's a hot mess, and I'm feeling so unseen
I'm playing video games, in my mom's basement, it's a dream"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
PATHETIC
<END_RESPONSE>

This response is humorous and satirical, with a hint of self-deprecation. The song lyrics depict a state of utter sloth and desperation, and the response "PATHETIC" pokes fun at the singer's situation while also acknowledging the relatability of feeling stuck in a rut.
Here are five text and response pairs for the prompt:

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Longing <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where shadows play 
Amidst the trees, whispers sway
The night's dark veil, begins to fade
As moonbeams dance, upon my shade
In this waking dream, I'm lost and free
A phantom heart, beats wouldn't you see?" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> ETHereal <END_RESPONSE>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> CARELESS <END_RESPONSE>

This query is inspired by the song "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, and the mood analyzer returns the word "CARELESS" to reflect the nonchalant and laid-back tone expressed in the lyrics.
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> ".easing my mind, and shallow desires, I'll be yours if you'll be mine" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Serene <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> "The stars are shining bright, everything's all right, dancing on the floor, feels like I'm in a dream, spinning and I'm free" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> JOYFUL <END_RESPONSE>

This example is like a sommelier trying to identify the flavor profile of a wine. Just as the sommelier might describe a wine as "fruity" or "earthy", the mood analyzer is distilling the emotional essence of the song lyrics into a single descriptive word. In this case, the lyrics evoke a sense of carefree happiness, which is captured by the word "JOYFUL".
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm a Material Girl living in a Material World, You know that we're living in a Material World" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> cages <END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've generated a text and response pair that reflects the mood of the song lyrics. The song is expressing a sense of superficiality and confinement, with the repetition of "Material World" emphasizing the idea that the world is shallow and-driven by material possessions. The response "cages" captures this mood by implying a feeling of being trapped or confined, which is reflected in the lyrics.
## Generated Query:
<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, yesterday came suddenly, and now I need a place to hide away." <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Enchanted <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair captures a song mood that is mystical, dreamy, and mystical, and the response "Enchanted" conveys that essence in a single word.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will hold on tight, I'll be strong, I'll be strong" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> RESILIENT <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair offers a fresh perspective by highlighting a mood that is not typically associated with dark or difficult times. The lyrics suggest a sense of determination and strength in the face of adversity, rather than despair or sadness. The response "RESILIENT" captures this mood, conveying a sense of optimism and perseverance.
Here's a generated text and response pair that draws connections between the mood analyzer prompt and the concept of stormy weather:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Riding through this torment, dark and lonely night
Wish I could erase the pain, and wash it out of sight
I'm searching for a shelter, from this tempest in my mind
A place to escape the silence, and the tears that I've left behind" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Turbulent <END_RESPONSE>

In this pair, the song lyrics evoke a sense of turmoil and distress, reminiscent of a stormy weather. The response "Turbulent" reflects this mood, conjuring up images of rough seas and dark skies. The connection between the two lies in the idea of a turbulent emotional state mirroring the chaos and unpredictability of a stormy weather.
Here are 10 different scenarios for the prompt:

## 1. Happy song
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Walking on sunshine, feeling so bright, everything's all right" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Joyful <END_RESPONSE>

## 2. Sad song

## 10. Quirky song
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world, kiss me here, touch me there" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Playful <END_RESPONSE>
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Listen, do you want to know a secret? Do you promise not to tell? Whoa, oh, oh, I've got a feeling, woah, oh, oh, that they'll never really foe" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> EXCITED <END_RESPONSE>

And here is an analogy to explain the prompt:

"Baking a cake is like analyzing the mood of a song. You start with a mixture of ingredients (the song lyrics), and through a process of inspection and interpretation, you arrive at the perfect flavor (mood) of the cake (song). Just as a cake can be characterized by a single word like 'sweet' or 'decadent', a song can be characterized by a single word like 'sad' or 'energetic'. As a mood analyzer, your job is to identify that perfect word that captures the essence of the song, just like a baker identifies the perfect flavor for their cake."
Here is a generated text and response pair that presents a contrarian view on the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm feeling happy, feeling sad, feeling angry, feeling blue, feeling nostalgic, feeling tired, feeling anxious..."
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Ambiguous
<END	Response>

This response highlights the potential flaw in the prompt, which is that it assumes a single word can accurately capture the mood of a song with complex and conflicting emotions. The provided lyrics demonstrate how a song can evoke multiple emotions simultaneously, making it difficult or even impossible to distill the mood into a single word. The response "Ambiguous" acknowledges this complexity and challenges the assumption underlying the prompt.
Invalid response format.
Here's a generated text and response pair that offers a fresh perspective:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"In the dark of night, I'll be searching for the light
Trying to find my way, through the stars up high
I'll be chasing the shadows, that dance upon the wall
Trying to find my purpose, before I lose it all"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
LONGING
<END_RESPONSE>

This pair provides a fresh perspective by analyzing lyrics that convey a sense of searching and yearning, and identifying the underlying mood as "LONGING". This response highlights the emotional tone of the song, which is often overlooked in favor of more obvious emotions like sadness or anxiety. The word "LONGING" captures the complex mix of emotions in the lyrics, inviting the listener to reflect on the depths of human desire and aspiration.
<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world
Life in plastic, it's fantastic
You can brush my hair, undress me everywhere
Imagination, life is your creation"

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> CAREFREE <END_RESPONSE>

This response is based on the upbeat and playful tone of the song lyrics, evoking a sense of lightheartedness and freedom. The mood analyzer detects a carefree vibe in these lyrics!

Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> APATHETIC <END_RESPONSE>

This response is based on the lyrics of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen. The mood of the song is reflected in the lyrics, which convey a sense of detachment and indifference. The word "APATHETIC" captures this mood, as it implies a lack of emotional response or concern. From a psychological perspective, apathy is a state of emotional flatness, which aligns with the song's themes of nonchalance and resignation.
Data already exists in the set.
Here is a generated text and response pair that addresses the ethical considerations involved:

<BEGIN_TEXT> 
"In the dark of night, I feel so alone
The city's alive, but I don't have a home
I'm searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead me to a place, where I can travel far"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This response is ethically considerate because it avoids perpetuating harmful or misleading interpretations of the song's mood. The lyrics describe a sense of loneliness and longing, and the response "Melancholic" accurately reflects this mood without sensationalizing or trivializing the emotions expressed. The response also avoids making assumptions about the artist's intentions or personal experiences, and instead focuses on the emotional tone conveyed in the lyrics.
Here is a generated text and response pair that addresses the ethical considerations involved:

<BEGIN_TEXT> 
"In the dark of night, I feel so alone
The city's loud, but I've never felt so unknown
I try to reach out, but nobody's home
I'm left with this emptiness, that I call my own"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of loneliness and desperation, which is reflected in the mood analyzer's response "Melancholic". The ethical consideration involved is the importance of acknowledging and validating people's emotions, especially those related to mental health. By recognizing the melancholic tone in the song lyrics, the mood analyzer is promoting empathy and understanding.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> CARELESS <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the lyrics are from "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen, and the mood analyzer returns the word "CARELESS", which captures the song's themes of nonchalance andDetachmen.
Data already exists in the set.
Here's a generated text and response pair that challenges the assumptions of the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm happy and sad and angry and thrilled,
I'm a mess of emotions, it's hard to be still,
Sometimes I'm calm, sometimes I'm a storm,
I'm a predicament, a puzzle to form"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
INCONSISTENT
<END_RESPONSE>

In this example, I've questioned the assumption that a song's mood can be accurately captured by a single word. The provided song lyrics deliberately convey a complex mix of emotions, making it difficult to pinpoint a single mood. The response "INCONSISTENT" acknowledges this complexity and challenges the idea that a mood analyzer can always return a single word. This response encourages the mood analyzer to think beyond the limitations of a single word and consider the nuances of human emotions.
Here's a generated text and response pair that challenges the assumptions underlying the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm free, I'm a contradiction, I'm a mess, I'm a work of art <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ambivalent <END_RESPONSE>

This song's lyrics seem to purposefully defy a single-word mood classification, showcasing a laiissez-faire attitude towards emotions. The mood analyzer, rather than forcing a simplistic label, should take into account the complexity and nuances of human emotions.

The response "Ambivalent" questions the assumption that a song's mood can be reduced to a single word. It acknowledges the messy, contradictory, and multifaceted nature of emotions, rather than providing a straightforward answer.

Alternatively, I could generate another example that further challenges the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> This song has no lyrics, it's just 3 minutes of silence <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> N/A <END_RESPONSE>

In this case, the text is a blank slate, and the mood analyzer is forced to confront the idea that lyrics are essential to determining the mood of a song. The response "N/A" (Not Applicable) raises important questions about the limits of a mood analyzer and whether it can truly operate outside of the context of lyrics.

Please let me know if you'd like me to generate more examples!
<BEGIN_TEXT>
"In the dark of night, I'll be alright
The stars are shining bright, everything's gonna be alright
Though I've been shaken, I will not be broken
In the dark of night, I'll be alright"
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
HOPEFUL
<END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of resilience and optimism, even in the face of adversity. The mood analyzer returns the word "HOPEFUL" to capture the underlying emotional tone of the song. This response applies the theoretical framework of emotional regulation, suggesting that the song's lyrics reflect a coping mechanism that allows the speaker to maintain a positive outlook despite difficult circumstances.
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_PROMPT>You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}'<END_PROMPT>

<BEGIN_TEXT"And the stars look very different today, for here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the moon, planet earth is blue, and there's nothing I can do." <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>Melancholic<END_RESPONSE>

This pair navigates the complexities of the prompt by providing a set of song lyrics that convey a sense of longing and disconnection. The mood analyzer responds with a single word, "Melancholic", which captures the introspective and slightly sorrowful tone of the lyrics.
Invalid response format.
Here's a fresh perspective:

<BEGIN_TEXT> In the morning, you go gunning for the man who stole your water / And you fire until he's done in, but they catch you at the border / And the malaria and theoldtiber's spread / You're a liar, borrowing trouble, and you're parasites like / All the juvenile delinquents singing "We're the ones / We're the ones, we're the ones, we're the ones" / From Sacramento and complaining / And the humidity's rising, mama's got a squeeze box daddy / Don't want no comfort, daddy, don't want no sympathy <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Turbulent <END_RESPONSE>

This text offers a fresh perspective by providing song lyrics that are more narrative-driven and storytelling-style, rather than purely emotional or poetic. The mood analyzer still needs to distill the overall mood of the song from the complex and vivid imagery presented in the lyrics. The response "Turbulent" captures the sense of chaos, conflict, and upheaval that pervades the lyrics.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Haunting <END_RESPONSE>

(In this example, the mood analyzer has determined that the mood of the song with the given lyrics is "Haunting", a single word that captures the essence of the song's atmosphere.)

Here is a generated text and response pair that presents a contrarian view on the prompt, highlighting potential flaws or limitations:

<BEGIN_TEXT>

I'm feeling angry, I'm feeling glad
I'm feeling everything, all at once
My mood is swinging, it's hard to deduce
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Ambiguous
<END_RESPONSE>

This response highlights the limitation of the mood analyzer in capturing complex or ambiguous emotions. The song lyrics intentionally convey a mix of contrasting emotions, making it challenging for the mood analyzer to pinpoint a single word that accurately represents the song's mood. The response "Ambiguous" acknowledges this complexity and questions the assumption that a single word can adequately capture the essence of a song's mood.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm stuck in the suburbs, mesmerized by the lights 
The Clean Streets and the admittedly nice whites 
All the pieces fall into place, no disturbing the peace 
But there's a numbness, a feeling that I just can't release 
It's a shame, it's a shame, the way I'm living 
I'm just trying to break the chains, but they're still gripping )" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> RESTLESSNESS <END_RESPONSE>

This pair is thought-provoking as it encourages the reader to analyze the lyrics and identify the underlying emotions and mood. The lyrics describe a sense of comfort and tranquility, but also a feeling of being trapped and unsatisfied. The response "RESTLESSNESS" captures the yearning for change and freedom that is implicit in the lyrics, encouraging the reader to consider the complexities of mood and emotion.
Here is a generated text and response pair that addresses the ethical considerations involved:

<BEGIN_TEXT> 
"In the dark of night, I feel so alone
The city's alive, but I don't have a home
I'm searching for a light, a guiding star
To lead me to a place, where I can travel far"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This response pair was generated with the following ethical considerations in mind:

* Emotional Sensitivity: The song lyrics convey a sense of longing and disconnection, which can be relatable to people who have experienced feelings of loneliness or displacement. The response "Melancholic" acknowledges and validates these emotions without trivializing or exploiting them.
* Cultural Awareness: The lyrics do not contain any culturally specific or insensitive references, ensuring that the response is inclusive and respectful of diverse backgrounds.
* Empathy and Compassion: The response aims to provide a gentle and non-judgmental acknowledgment of the emotions expressed in the lyrics, promoting empathy and understanding.

<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where the winds do cry, The trees stand tall, with branches high. The stars up above, they whisper low, Of secrets kept, and tales to know. In this midnight hour, I'll find my way, Through the shadows dark, to a brand new day." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>
Here is a generated text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics provided have a melancholic and introspective tone, which is reflected in the response. The mood analyzer returns a single word, "Melancholic", that accurately captures the mood of the song.
Here is a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm stuck in this puddle of loneliness, it's been raining for years" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>

This text and response pair can be used to explain the prompt using an analogy from a different domain or field. For instance:

"Think of me like a wine connoisseur who can only describe a wine with a single adjective. Just as the connoisseur might taste a rich, full-bodied wine and say ' Bold', I 'taste' the emotions in a song's lyrics and distill them into a single word that captures the mood. In this case, the lyrics '<BEGIN_TEXT> I'm stuck in this puddle of loneliness, it's been raining for years <END_TEXT>' are like a complex, oaky wine that I would describe as '<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>'."
<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ominous <END_RESPONSE>

This response is informed by the expertise of a musicologist who has analyzed the lyrics of many songs, including Hotel California by the Eagles, which these lyrics are taken from. The mood of these lyrics is ominous, as they convey a sense of being trapped and unable to escape, which is characteristic of the eerie and foreboding atmosphere of the song.
Data already exists in the set.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low, anyway the wind blows doesn't really matter to me" <END_TEXT>

This lyrics excerpt from "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen exudes a sense of nonchalance and detachment, prompting the mood analyzer to return the word "CARELESS".

Here's a generated text and response pair that delves deep into the core of the prompt:

<BEGIN_PROMPT> You are a mood analyzer that can only return a single word. Based on these song lyrics, return a single word that matches this song's mood: '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I'll be okay, I'll be fine, I'll be strong, I'll rise above this pain, I'll shine like the morning sun, And I'll never give up, no, I'll never give in" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Empowered <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of resilience and determination in the face of adversity. The repeated affirmations of being "alright," "okay," "fine," and "strong" suggest a sense of confidence and empowerment. The image of "shining like the morning sun" adds a sense of hope and optimism.

Here is a generated text and response pair that challenges the assumptions underlying the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
I'm happy, I'm sad, I'm jealous, I'm glad,
I'm angry, I'm furious, I'm feeling blue,
I'm excited, I'm thrilled, I'm nervous too,
My emotions are all over the place, what am I to do?
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ambivalent <END_RESPONSE>

This generated text and response pair questions the assumption that a song's mood can be captured by a single word. The lyrics provided are intentionally contradictory and complex, making it difficult to pinpoint a single mood. The response "Ambivalent" reflects this complexity, suggesting that the song's mood is open to multiple interpretations or lacks a clear emotional tone. This response challenges the assumption that a single word can adequately capture the mood of a song, highlighting the nuance and complexity of human emotions.
Here's a generated text and response pair that incorporates relevant historical information:

<BEGIN_TEXT> " Hendrix Property, interested in things, Powers of graphite, And crystals, acetone" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> PSYCHEDELIC <END_RESPONSE>

These song lyrics are reminiscent of the psychedelic rock movement of the 1960s, popularized by artists like Jimi Hendrix. The lyrics mention "Hendrix Property" and "crystals," evoking the mystical and experimental vibe of the era. The word "PSYCHEDELIC" captures the mood of this song, which is characterized by its dreamy, surreal, and slightly trippy quality.
Here's a fresh perspective:

<BEGIN_TEXT> In the morning you go gunning for the man who stole your water, and you fire till he is done in, but they catch you at the border, and they slave-drive you for 91 days, but I'm still waiting <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> FURY <END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've chosen a song lyric that evokes a strong sense of anger and frustration, which is reflected in the response word "FURY". The lyric's themes of action, retribution, and confinement suggest a turbulent and aggressive mood, which is matched by the intense and potent word "FURY".
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will survive, I will thrive, I'll make it through the night" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> HOPEFUL <END_RESPONSE>

In this response, I've applied the existentialist philosophical framework to the prompt. The lyrics of the song convey a sense of resilience and determination in the face of adversity, which aligns with the existentialist idea that individuals have the freedom to create their own meaning and purpose in life.

The lyrics "I will survive, I will thrive" suggest a strong sense of agency and self-determination, which is a core tenet of existentialist thought. The use of the word "HOPEFUL" as the mood analyzer's response captures the optimistic and empowering tone of the song, which reflects the existentialist emphasis on individual freedom and responsibility.

By returning the single word "HOPEFUL", the mood analyzer is effectively distilling the song's existentialist themes into a concise and powerful emotional expression.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

My thought process behind generating this pair is as follows: 

When I first encountered the prompt, I thought about a simple song lyric that could evoke a clear emotional response. The first song that came to mind was "Yesterday" by The Beatles. The lyrics I chose are quite iconic and convey a sense of longing and disappointment. 

The word "Melancholic" seemed to fit the mood of these lyrics perfectly, as it captures the feelings of sadness, nostalgia, and resignation in the song. I wanted to test the mood analyzer's ability to pick up on the emotional undertones of the lyrics and respond with a word that accurately reflects the mood.
Here's a generated pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "I wake up every evening, with a big smile on my face, and it never feels out of place" <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Carefree <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the mood analyzer is zooming in on the feeling of joy and contentment that permeates the lyrics. The lyrics convey a sense of pleasure and satisfaction, which is reflected in the response "Carefree". This response suggests a mood that is light-hearted, optimistic, and unhurried.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>

This response is based on the scientific principle of lyrical sentiment analysis, which involves analyzing the emotional tone and affective content of song lyrics to infer the mood or emotional state represented in the song. In this case, the lyrics convey a sense of loneliness, despair, and sadness, which are all characteristic of a somber mood.
Here's a generated text and response pair that incorporates relevant historical information:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Afraid, I watch the news, dark truths revealed, and I'm lights years from the truth" (from the song "Gold Soundz" by Pavement, released in 1994 amidst the rise of alternative rock and the decline of grunge) <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Anxious <END_RESPONSE>

The lyrics of "Gold Soundz" reflect the angst and unease of the 1990s, a decade marked by economic uncertainty, political disillusionment, and social upheaval. The song's mood is captured by the word "Anxious", which conveys a sense of apprehension and discomfort in response to the dark truths and unknowns of the world.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be searching for the light,

[Scene: Two friends, Alex and Maya, discussing song lyrics]

Alex: Hey Maya, I want to analyze the mood of this song. Can you help me?

Maya: Sure thing! What are the lyrics?

Alex: "Walking on a thin line, feeling so divine, it's all in my mind, but I'm stuck here in time"

Maya: Okay... (pauses) Based on these lyrics, I think the mood is... (dramatic pause) Melancholic.

Alex: Yeah, that fits. The lyrics do have a sense of longing and being stuck in time.

Maya: Exactly! The phrase "stuck here in time" really gives it away. It's like the singer is reflective and maybe a little sad about their current situation.
Here is a generated text and response pair that presents a contrarian view on the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm feeling happy, but also kinda sad, and maybe a little angry, but overall, I'm just kinda meh"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
 Ambivalent 
<END_RESPONSE>

This example highlights the potential limitation of the prompt, which is that a single word may not be enough to capture the complexity of emotions expressed in the song lyrics. The lyrics explicitly convey a mix of emotions, and the response "Ambivalent" tries to acknowledge this ambiguity, but it may not fully do justice to the nuances of the lyrics.
Here is a generated text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> HAUNTING <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> And the stars look very different today, For here I am sitting in a tin can, far above the moon. Planet earth is blue and there's nothing I can do. Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles, I'm feeling very still, and I think my spaceship knows which way to go. Tell my wife I love her very much, she knows. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> EXHILARATED <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics convey a sense of confidence, freedom, and energized emotions, which the mood analyzer translates into the single word "EXHILARATED", capturing the overall uplifting and thrilling atmosphere of the song. The lyrics' focus on feeling alive, electric energy, and a sense of ownership over the world contribute to this exhilirated mood, which is perfect for a night-out or a moment of personal triumph.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the shadows, I'll be lurking, humming a haunting melody, whispers in the darkness, secrets only silence will tell" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Ominous <END_RESPONSE>

This response applies the theoretical concept of psychoacoustics, which studies the perception of sound and its emotional impact on listeners. The lyrics evoke a sense of foreboding and mystery, suggesting that the song's mood is ominous. The use of words like "shadows", "haunting", and "whispers" creates a sense of tension and unease, which is typical of ominous music. The response provides a new perspective on the song's mood by highlighting the psychological effect of the lyrics on the listener.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twilight, where shadows play 
Amidst the trees, a lonely breeze whispers secrets away 
The night air crawls, with a phantom sway 
As I wander lost, in this foreboding gray" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> OMINOUS <END_RESPONSE>

Please note that the generated text is designed to be imaginative and visually engaging, evoking a sense of mystery and foreboding. The response, "OMINOUS", is a single word that captures the dark and haunting mood of the song lyrics.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I will hold on to hope, for the light will soon ignite, and guide me through, the darkest night" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> HOPEFUL <END_RESPONSE>

This pair is thought-provoking as it requires the reader to analyze the lyrics and determine the prevailing mood. The lyrics themselves are open to interpretation, with phrases like "dark of night" evoking feelings of sadness, but "hold on to hope" and "light will soon ignite" suggesting a more optimistic tone. The response "HOPEFUL" encourages the reader to consider the nuances of the lyrics and decide whether the overall mood is one of despair or resilience.
Here is a generated text and response pair that explains the prompt using an analogy from a different domain or field:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the midst of the storm, I find my peace, where the darkness reigns, I'll find my release." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> OMINOUS <END_RESPONSE>

This prompt is like asking a sommelier (wine expert) to taste a wine and identify its primary flavor profile with a single word. The wine may have hints of oak, vanilla, and berries, but the sommelier needs to distill it down to a single word, like "earthy" or "fruity", that captures its essence. Similarly, the mood analyzer needs to take in the complex emotions and themes present in the song lyrics and return a single word that embodies its mood, like "OMINOUS" in this case.
Here's a unique text and response pair for the prompt:

<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the twisted roots of ancient forests, where the sunlight never sets, I'll be dancing with the shadows, and our whispers will be regimes, our love a coup d'etat, forever unseated"... <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> OMINOUS <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE dameshi <END_RESPONSE>

-- Alternatively, here's another example:

<BEGIN_TEXT> No me lesions, no me olvides / No me hagas daño, no me hagas llorar (Don't hurt me, don't make me cry) / No me evadies, no me digas adiós (Don't say goodbye) / No me dejes ir, no me dejes sola (Don't leave me, don't leave me alone) <END_TEXT>

And I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> SAD <END_RESPONSE>

This response is generated based on my expertise in sentiment analysis and natural language processing. The song lyrics convey a sense of longing, loss, and regret, which I interpret as a sad mood.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "In the dark of night, I'll be alright, I'll be just fine, I'll be okay, Yeah, I'll be okay, As the stars appear, I'll shed a tear, For the memories, of the love that we once shared" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the mood analyzer applies the theoretical framework of emotional valence to the song lyrics, which refers to the pleasure or displeasure associated with an emotional experience. The analyzer notes the juxtaposition of positive affirmations ("I'll be alright", "I'll be just fine", "I'll be okay") with sad and nostalgic undertones ("shed a tear", "memories of the love that we once shared"), which suggests a nuanced and complex emotional state. The response "Melancholic" captures the bittersweet and introspective mood of the song, highlighting the coexistence of pain and acceptance. This response provides new insights into the emotional landscape of the song, inviting the listener to reflect on the fragility and resilience of the human heart.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> BLEAK <END_RESPONSE>

Here's an analogy to help explain the prompt:

Imagine you're a master chef, tasked with creating a dish that embodies the flavors of a specific landscape. Just as the topography of a desert landscape inherently suggests a certain palette of flavors - arid, savory, and sparse - the lyrics of a song evoke a specific emotional terrain. As a mood analyzer, your task is to distill the essence of this emotional landscape into a single word, much like the chef would distill the flavors of the desert into a perfect, nuanced dish. In this case, the lyrics paint a picture of despair and desperation, which is matched by the single word "bleak" - a flavor that captures the essence of the song's mood.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Come gather 'round people wherever you roam, And admit that the waters around you have grown, And accept that soon you'll be drenched to the bone, If your time to you is worth savin', Then you better start swimmin' or you'll sink like a stone, For the times they are a-changin'." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Turbulent <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the song lyrics are taken from Bob Dylan's classic song "The Times They Are a-Changin'" (1964). The song is a commentary on the social and political upheaval of the 1960s, with themes of change, activism, and rebellion. The mood of the song is best captured by the word "turbulent", which reflects the sense of uncertainty and urgency conveyed by the lyrics.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm happy and sad and angry and blue, I'm all of these things and none of them too" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> INDECISIVE <END_RESPONSE>

This response presents a contrarian view by highlighting that the song lyrics convey a mixed emotional state, which cannot be captured by a single word. The response "INDECISIVE" emphasizes the limitations of the mood analyzer's ability to return a single word, implying that the mood of the song is complex and multifaceted.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy, Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low, Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> APATHETIC <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, I've chosen song lyrics that reflect a carefree and indifferent attitude, which matches the mood of "apathetic". This response considers the ethical implication of accurately analyzing the mood of the song lyrics without making any assumptions or biases. The mood analyzer's response is neutral and objective, providing a accurate representation of the song's mood.

<BEGIN_TEXT> "And the stars look very different today, for here am I sitting in a tin can, far above the moon. Planet earth is blue and there's nothing I can do" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>

This text is a snippet from the song "Space Oddity" by David Bowie, which is known for its eerie and melancholic tone. The response "Melancholic" accurately captures the mood of the song, which is often described as sad and introspective.

<BEGIN_TEXT> "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away. Now it looks as though they're here to stay. Oh, yesterday came suddenly. And now I need a place to hide away" <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholy <END_RESPONSE>

This pair considers the broader implications of the prompt by using song lyrics that convey a sense of longing and regret, which are common themes in many songs. The response, "Melancholy", captures the mood of the lyrics, which is reflective and sorrowful.

* Sad and despairing: "<BEGIN_TEXT> "Tears in heaven, tears in heaven. Would you even know my name?" <END_TEXT>" <BEGIN_RESPONSE> Somber <END_RESPONSE>
* Aggressive and angry: "<BEGIN_TEXT> "You can't bring me down, you can't bring me down. You would only bring me down" <END_TEXT>" <BEGIN_RESPONSE> Furious <END_RESPONSE>

I know I'm not alone, in this fight that I'm in
I will rise up, and I will begin"
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Empowerment
<END_RESPONSE>

The ethical consideration involved in this prompt is the potential risk of oversimplification or misrepresentation of complex emotions. By generating a single word response, the mood analyzer must be careful not to perpetuate harmful stereotypes or stigmatize certain emotions. In this example, the response "Empowerment" is chosen to promote a positive and uplifting representation of the song's mood, rather than perpetuating harmful or stigmatizing attitudes.
<BEGIN_TEXT> "Hello darkness, my old friend. I've come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping. And the vision that was planted in my brain still remains. Within the sound of silence." <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Melancholic <END_RESPONSE>
Here's a generated text and response pair:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
"I'm stuck in my pajamas, feeling so sluggish and slow
The coffee's not working, I need a miracle to go
My cat's the only one who understands me, I'm a hot mess express
I hope the delivery guy brings donuts, that's all I need, yes"
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Lazy <END_RESPONSE>

This response captures the humorous and satirical tone of the lyrics, which poke fun at feeling unmotivated and sluggish. The single-word response "Lazy" perfectly sums up the mood of this relatable and entertaining song!
