Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking you questions until he has enough information to provide the needed output (for example, 'From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to...').\n- This principle encourages an interactive approach, where the model asks clarifying questions to ensure it fully understands the task before providing a response.\n\n4. When formatting your prompt, start with '###Instruction###', followed by either '###Example###' or '###Question###' if relevant. Subsequently, present your content. Use one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.\n- This principle provides a structured format for prompts, improving readability and ensuring that instructions and examples are clearly separated from input data.\n\n5. Repeat a specific word or phrase multiple times within a prompt.\n- This principle suggests that repetition can emphasize key points, ensuring the model focuses on critical aspects of the prompt.\n\n(Note: Since the request mentioned 26 principles but provided only 5, I will base the remaining analysis on the assumption that the list is a subset and extrapolate from there.)",
