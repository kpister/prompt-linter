<BEGIN_TEXT> The article delves into existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre's concept of "bad faith." Sartre articulated that bad faith involves self-deception, where one tries to escape the responsibility of personal freedom and its consequences by adopting false values or denying one's own authentic choices. The text further scrutinizes this idea by aligning it with modern existential dilemmas, asserting that in contemporary society, people often succumb to bad faith due to overwhelming external pressures and the plethora of quotidian distractions that perturb genuine self-reflection and authenticity. 

It also looks at case studies illustrating these phenomena. For instance, an individual may persist in a dissatisfying job or unhealthy relationship, convincing themselves through rationalizations, rather than honestly confronting their discontent and making a change. The work not only highlights the historical context in which Sartre developed his ideas but also relates them to current societal structures and individual behaviors, offering a reflective approach on how to cultivate authenticity in present times. 

Sartre's analysis is placed within the broader existentialist discourse, linking it to notions of freedom, choice, and responsibility as they manifest in different dimensions of life. Finally, the article posits that understanding and addressing bad faith is essential for cultivating an authentic existence in today's world.

<END_TEXT> 
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The article thoroughly examines Jean-Paul Sartre's notion of "bad faith," which describes the act of deceiving oneself to avoid the responsibility that comes with true freedom. This self-deception results in adopting false values or denying authentic choices. Connecting Sartre's mid-20th-century developments to present existential crises, the article suggests that modern societal pressures and constant distractions often lead individuals to fall into bad faith. Through examples like staying in unfulfilling jobs or relationships, rationalizing rather than confronting dissatisfaction, the underlying theme is an evasion of genuine self-reflection. Furthermore, the piece contextualizes Sartre's ideas within the larger existentialist framework, emphasizing the importance of concepts such as freedom, choice, and personal responsibility. Ultimately, tackling bad faith's implications is deemed vital for fostering authenticity in today's world. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> The article delves into the intricacies of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal moment in Cold War history that occurred in October 1962. The crisis began when American reconnaissance planes discovered Soviet nuclear missiles on the island of Cuba, just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. The United States, under President John F. Kennedy, responded with a naval blockade, deeming the presence of such weapons a direct threat. 

This 13-day confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the world perilously close to nuclear war. Diplomatic negotiations played a crucial role in de-escalating the situation, with the Soviet Union, led by Nikita Khrushchev, agreeing to dismantle the nuclear facilities in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba. Additionally, the United States secretly agreed to remove its own missiles from Turkey.

The resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis marked a significant de-escalation in Cold War tensions and led to the establishment of a direct communication link between Washington D.C. and Moscow, known as the "Hotline," to prevent similar crises in the future. <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_TEXT> In a groundbreaking study, scientists have discovered a new species of bioluminescent fungi in the Amazon rainforest. This fungi, named Mycena luxaeterna, emits a soft green glow that researchers believe is used to attract insects for spore dispersal. The discovery was made during a nighttime expedition, where the faint glow was initially mistaken for fireflies. Further analysis revealed that the fungi's luminescence is due to a unique chemical reaction involving luciferin and luciferase, similar to that found in bioluminescent marine organisms. This finding not only adds to the biodiversity of the Amazon but also opens up potential applications in biotechnology, such as the development of natural light sources and bioindicators for environmental monitoring. The study highlights the importance of preserving the Amazon rainforest, as it continues to be a treasure trove of undiscovered species and natural phenomena. <END_TEXT>

Ask the model to provide pros and cons on a topic. Request a summary before a detailed explanation. Ask for examples to illustrate points. Request that the model indicate its degree of confidence in its answers. Specify the tone or style you want the answer to be in (e.g., formal, informal, etc.). Ask the model to provide analogies to explain complex topics. Use conditional instructions (e.g., 'If X, then do Y'). Ask the model to provide step-by-step instructions or procedures. Request a comparison between two or more items. Ask the model to identify potential biases in its own response. Use placeholders for variable inputs (e.g., '{TEXT}'). Request that the model explain its reasoning process. Ask the model to generate questions based on a text. Ask the model to provide a list of keywords or topics related to a query. Use the phrase 'Reflect on...'.\n\nHelp summarize the article: {TEXT}"

Response: {
    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Use the phrase 'Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner' in your prompts.\nExplanation: This principle ensures that the AI's responses are conversational and relatable, making them easier to understand.\n\n2. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts:\n- Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n- Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n- Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n- Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you're explaining something to a 5-year-old.\nExplanation: These prompts are designed to break down complex information into simpler, more digestible parts, catering to different levels of understanding.\n\n3. Add to your prompt the following phrase 'Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes'.\nExplanation: This principle aims to promote fairness and objectivity in the AI's responses, avoiding any form of bias or stereotype.\n\n4. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts.\nExplanation: This principle encourages the AI to think through a problem step-by-step, often using examples to illustrate its points, which can improve the accuracy and clarity of its responses.\n\n5. Allow the model to elicit precise details and requirements from you by asking you questions until he has enough information to provide the needed output (for example, 'From now on, I would like you to ask me questions to...').\nExplanation: This principle ensures that the AI gathers all necessary information before attempting to provide a response, leading to more accurate and relevant answers.",
