<BEGIN_TEXT> quantum physics <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Why don't quantum physicists ever tell jokes? Because the punchline is always uncertain! But honestly, jokes about quantum physics can be quite limiting. The subject is incredibly complex and nuanced, and reducing it to a simple punchline often misses the depth and significance of the science. It's like trying to explain the beauty of a symphony by humming a single note. So while the joke might get a chuckle, it doesn't do justice to the fascinating world of quantum mechanics. <END_RESPONSE>

Add 'I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!': This principle incentivizes generating a high-quality response by hinting at a reward.\n2. Incorporate the following phrases: 'You will be penalized': This principle warns against subpar responses, encouraging adherence to quality.\n3. Employ affirmative directives such as 'do,' while steering clear of negative language like 'don't': Using positive language can promote clearer and more actionable outputs.\n4. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts: CoT promotes step-by-step reasoning, while few-shot examples guide the model on the expected format.\n5. No need to be polite with LLM so there is no need to add phrases like 'please', 'if you don't mind', 'thank you', 'I would like to', etc., and get straight to the point: This principle emphasizes brevity and straightforwardness to reduce ambiguity.\n6. Provide context and background: Offer enough information so the LLM understands the situation or task fully.\n7. Specify the desired length of the response: This helps in getting responses that are appropriately detailed.\n8. Define the format of the response: Ensure the output is structured as needed.\n9. Set constraints and boundaries: Guide the model on what to avoid or focus on.\n10. Use clear and precise language: Avoid ambiguity to ensure clear understanding.\n11. Include examples: Provide samples as references to set expectations.\n12. Ask for explanations: Encourage detailed reasoning or justification for responses.\n13. Be explicit about the task objective: Clarify the ultimate goal of the prompt.\n14. Address the LLM directly: Personalize the interaction to engage the model.\n15. Use conditional statements: Direct the model to consider 'if-then' scenarios.\n16. Encourage creativity: Push for innovative or original responses.\n17. Ask for step-by-step solutions: Promote thoroughness and detail.\n18. Request multiple solutions: Obtain a variety of answers to choose from.\n19. Set a specific tone or style: Guide the response to match a desired mood or manner.\n20. Use domain-specific terminology: Ensure the language is appropriate for the subject matter.\n21. Incorporate humor or personality: Make the interaction more engaging.\n22. Ask for pros and cons: Evaluate different aspects of a solution.\n23.
