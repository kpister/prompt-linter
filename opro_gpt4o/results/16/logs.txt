    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. **Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes**: This principle ensures that the response is fair and free from any prejudiced views.\n2. **Break down the complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation**: This principle helps in managing complex tasks by dividing them into smaller, more manageable parts.\n3. **Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner**: This principle ensures that the response is conversational and easy to understand.\n4. **Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting)**: This principle involves providing examples to guide the model in generating the desired output.\n5. **When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: 'From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question]'**: This principle ensures that multi-file code generation is handled efficiently.\n6. **Use clear and specific instructions**: This principle ensures that the prompt is easy to understand and follow.\n7. **Provide context or background information**: This principle helps the model understand the task better by providing relevant context.\n8. **Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses**: This principle encourages the model to provide more comprehensive answers.\n9. **Specify the format of the response**: This principle ensures that the response is in the desired format.\n10. **Use constraints to limit the scope of the response**: This principle helps in keeping the response focused and relevant.\n11. **Encourage critical thinking and reasoning**: This principle promotes thoughtful and well-reasoned responses.\n12. **Use positive reinforcement**: This principle encourages the model to generate high-quality responses by acknowledging good performance.\n13. **Ask for step-by-step solutions**: This principle helps in breaking down the problem-solving process.\n14. **Use analogies or metaphors**: This principle helps in explaining complex concepts in a simpler way.\n15. **Encourage creativity and originality**: This principle promotes innovative and unique responses.\n16. **Use humor appropriately**: This principle makes the interaction more engaging and enjoyable.\n17. **Ask for multiple perspectives**: This principle encourages the model to consider different viewpoints.\n18. **Encourage self-reflection**: This principle promotes introspection and self-assessment.\n19. **Use storytelling techniques**: This principle makes the response more engaging and memorable.\n20. **Encourage empathy and understanding**: This principle promotes compassionate and considerate responses.\n21. **Use visual aids or diagrams**: This principle helps in explaining concepts more clearly.\n22. **Encourage collaboration and teamwork**: This principle promotes cooperative problem-solving.\n23. **Use real-world examples**: This principle makes the response more relatable and practical.\n24. **Encourage goal-setting and planning**: This principle promotes strategic thinking and organization.\n25. **Use reflective listening**: This principle ensures that the model understands and acknowledges the user's input.\n26. **Encourage continuous learning and improvement**: This principle promotes ongoing development and enhancement of skills.",
