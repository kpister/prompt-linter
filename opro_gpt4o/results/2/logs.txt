<BEGIN_TEXT> Hegelian dialectic <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The core characteristics of Hegel’s dialectic, which encompass the synthesis from the contradictions of thesis and antithesis, need to be understood within the domain of human consciousness and the unfolding of absolute spirit. Here, Hegel's methodology reveals that every development or historical event consists of inconsistent contradictions that eventually lead to resolution and higher understanding.

In this intricately interwoven system, one must appreciate that each moment or 'minute particular' of dialectical progression simultaneously negates and preserves previous realities. Thus, in comprehending the Hegelian dialectic, it is vital to recognize the teleological nature, where every stage of development inheres a purpose directed towards the realization of ultimate knowledge or the "absolute idea." 

By laying emphasis on this, the observer acknowledges the process of Aufhebung (sublation), suggesting that oppositional forces do not merely cancel each other out, but elevate the conflict to a new, more comprehensively unified state. Hence, the core characteristics of Hegel’s dialectic indicate a dynamic and relational progression towards the holistic attainment of truth, embodying both destruction and preservation in a cyclical pattern of evolution.

<BEGIN_TEXT> nature of existentialism <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> core premise that "existence precedes essence." Existentialism, rooted in the works of philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Søren Kierkegaard, suggests that individual existence is the primary reality and that humans define their own essence and meaning through action and personal responsibility. Consequently, in the framework of existentialism, any examination of core characteristics should focus not on pre-determined attributes but on the choices and actions undertaken by an individual, emphasizing the fluid and dynamic essence of human identity. This underscores the significance of authentic self-expression and the conscious navigation of one's existence within an often indifferent or absurd world. As each person's essence is exclusive to their existential journey, core characteristics become mutable and context-dependent rather than fixed or universally defined. In light of this, one's core characteristics are continually shaped by their commitment to and engagement with their own subjective experiences and existence. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Also consider relativity theory's core characteristics given the framework within which it was developed. Relativity is fundamentally about how different observers perceive space and time, structured around the ideas that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is constant regardless of motion. These principles lead to groundbreaking implications, such as time dilation and length contraction, which challenge our classical intuitions about the universe. Furthermore, the theory's robustness in predicting phenomena like the bending of light in gravitational fields and the time delay of signals traveling near massive objects has solidified its core tenet that spacetime is a dynamic, malleable fabric influenced by mass and energy. Given this, relativity pushes us to reconsider our metaphysical and epistemological assumptions about reality, making it a pivotal concept that bridges empirical science and philosophical inquiry.

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Break down the complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.\n   - This principle emphasizes simplifying complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller, manageable prompts, facilitating an interactive and step-by-step approach.\n\n2. To correct/change specific text without changing its style: 'Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should not change the writing style, such as making a formal paragraph casual'.\n   - This principle focuses on refining text by enhancing grammar and vocabulary while preserving the original writing style.\n\n3. When formatting your prompt, start with '###Instruction###', followed by either '###Example###' or '###Question###' if relevant. Subsequently, present your content. Use one or more line breaks to separate instructions, examples, questions, context, and input data.\n   - This principle provides a structured format for prompts, ensuring clarity and separation of different sections.\n\n4. Incorporate the following phrases: 'Your task is' and 'You MUST'.\n   - This principle mandates the inclusion of specific phrases to clearly define the task and emphasize its importance.\n\n5. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions:\n   - Please use the same language based on the provided paragraph[/title/text/essay/answer].\n   - This principle ensures that the generated text matches the language and style of a given sample.\n\n6. Use clear and concise language to avoid ambiguity.\n   - This principle emphasizes the importance of clarity and brevity in prompts to prevent misunderstandings.\n\n7. Provide context or background information when necessary.\n   - This principle highlights the need to include relevant context to help the model understand the task better.\n\n8. Specify the desired length or format of the response.\n   - This principle ensures that the response meets specific length or format requirements.\n\n9. Use examples to illustrate the desired output.\n   - This principle suggests including examples to guide the model towards the expected output.\n\n10. Encourage the model to think step-by-step.\n   - This principle promotes a methodical approach to problem-solving by encouraging step-by-step thinking.\n\n11. Ask the model to explain its reasoning.\n   - This principle involves prompting the model to provide explanations for its responses, enhancing transparency and understanding.\n\n12. Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses.\n   - This principle suggests using open-ended questions to elicit more comprehensive and detailed answers.\n\n13. Avoid leading questions that may bias the response.\n   - This principle advises against using questions that could influence the model's response in a particular direction.\n\n14. Use specific and unambiguous terms.\n   - This principle emphasizes the importance of using precise language to avoid confusion.\n\n15. Provide feedback on the model's responses to improve future performance.\n   - This principle involves giving feedback to help the model learn and improve over time.\n\n16. Encourage the model to ask clarifying questions if needed.\n   - This principle promotes interactive communication by allowing the model to seek clarification when necessary.\n\n17. Use conditional statements to guide the model's behavior.\n   - This principle suggests using conditional statements to direct the model's actions based on specific conditions.\n\n18. Specify the tone or style of the response.\n   - This principle ensures that the response matches the desired tone or style.\n\n19. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity.\n   - This principle recommends using lists to organize information clearly and concisely.\n\n20. Encourage the model to verify its answers.\n   - This principle promotes accuracy by encouraging the model to double-check its responses.\n\n21. Use analogies or metaphors to explain complex concepts.\n   - This principle suggests using analogies or metaphors to simplify and clarify complex ideas.\n\n22.
