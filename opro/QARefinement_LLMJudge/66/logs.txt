The provided code calculates the total cost of a list of prices with a discount rate and shipping cost. Here's a revised version with reduced cognitive complexity:

```
def calculate_total_cost(prices, discount_rate, shipping_cost):
    total_cost = sum(prices)
    if total_cost > 100:
        total_cost *= (1 - discount_rate)
    total_cost += shipping_cost
    return total_cost
```

Changes:

1. Replaced the manual loop with the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total cost, reducing the number of lines and making the code more concise.

The resulting code is more readable and easier to understand, with a lower cognitive complexity.

From a cognitive complexity reduction perspective, the provided code can be approached through the lens of information processing theory. This theory posits that humans have limited capacity for processing information, and that complexity arises from the cognitive effort required to comprehend and execute tasks.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the code, we can apply several strategies inspired by this theoretical framework. Firstly, we can simplify the naming conventions to reduce the cognitive load associated with symbol recognition. For instance, renaming `mtx_dict` to `message_counts` and `mtx_total` to `total_messages` can improve code readability.

Secondly, we can break down the code into smaller, more manageable chunks, reducing the need for working memory to hold complex mental representations. This can be achieved by extracting the logic for updating the `message_counts` dictionary into a separate function.

Thirdly, we can leverage Haskell's functional programming principles to reduce the cognitive complexity associated with variable assignments and mutable state. By using immutable data structures and pure functions, we can minimize the cognitive effort required to reason about the code's behavior.

Here is the refactored code:
```
def update_message_counts(frame,payload_type,direction,message_counts):
    if direction == 'M' and payload_type == 'mtx':
        message_counts[frame] = message_counts.get(frame, 0) + 1
    return message_counts

def calculate_totalmtx_messages(cfg, data):
    message_counts = {}
    for item in data:
        message_counts = update_message_counts(item['frame'], item['payload_type'], item['direction'], message_counts)
    total_messages = sum(message_counts.values())
    if total_messages > cfg.MAX_MESSAGES_PER_FRAME:
        raise ValueError(f'Max Messages Per Frame exceeded: {total_messages}')
    return total_messages
```
By applying these strategies, we can reduce the cognitive complexity of the code, making it more maintainable, readable, and efficient to execute.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the provided code, we can simplify it by using list comprehensions and the built-in `sum` function. Here's the refactored code:

In this refactored version, we've eliminated the need for an explicit loop and instead used the `zip` function to iterate over the `prices` and `tax_rates` lists in parallel. The calculation is then performed using a generator expression, which is concise and efficient. This change reduces the cognitive complexity of the code by making it more readable and easier to understand.

I'd like to challenge the assumption that reducing cognitive complexity is always the superior approach. While simplifying the code can make it more maintainable, it may also compromise the nuance and accuracy of the original implementation.

In this particular case, the code is already relatively straightforward, with a clear and concise logic for calculating the total. Reducing cognitive complexity might result in a "dumbing down" of the logic, losing the important distinctions between 'shipped' and 'pending' statuses.

Instead of focusing solely on simplicity, we should consider the trade-offs and potential consequences of oversimplification. Perhaps a more effective approach would be to add clear comments or documentation to explain the rational behind the code, rather than sacrificing its accuracy or effectiveness for the sake of brevity.

In fact, studies have shown that what might appear as "cognitive complexity" to one developer might be perfectly clear to another, depending on their individual experiences and domain knowledge. By prioritizing simplicity over clarity, we risk creating code that is deceptively "simple" but ultimately more prone to errors or misinterpretation.

Let's reconsider our approach and prioritize a balanced blend of clarity, maintainability, and accuracy in our code.ager, [1] rather than solely focusing on reducing cognitive complexity.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can start by breaking down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions. One way to do this is by creating separate functions for each type of item ('A', 'B', and 'C'). This would allow us to eliminate the if-elif chain and make the code more readable.

Additionally, we could consider using a dictionary to map the item types to their respective pricing rules, which would make the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

Here's an updated version of the code that incorporates these suggestions:

def calculate_type_a(item):
    return item['price'] * item['quantity']

def calculate_type_b(item):
    return item['price'] * item['quantity'] * 0.9

def calculate_type_c(item):

By extracting the item cost calculation and discount application into separate functions, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `calculate_total_cost` function, we can simplify the code by using a list comprehension and the `sum` function. Here's a revised version:

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(price * tax_rate / (1 - tax_rate) for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))

This revised code achieves the same result as the original, but with fewer lines of code and a more concise syntax. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the `prices` and `tax_rates` lists in parallel, and the list comprehension calculates the total cost in a single, readable line.

By eliminating the need for an explicit loop and using built-in Python functions, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

However, we should also consider whether the high cognitive complexity of this code is a symptom of a larger issue. 

For instance, are weMicro-optimizing by trying to reduce the cognitive complexity of this specific code snippet, or should we be taking a step back to look at the overall design of our application? 

Perhaps there are opportunities to simplify the data structures or workflows that lead to this complex code. 

Let's prioritize refactoring the code to make it more readable and maintainable, but also keep in mind that this might be a sign of a deeper issue that needs to be addressed.

Also, the function name `calculate_total案精品encrypted_data` seems to be a mix of English and Chinese. It's better to stick to one language for variable naming to improve code readability.

The given function calculates the total cost of an order based on the inventory level of each item. The cognitive complexity can be reduced by simplifying the conditional logic and reducing the number of magic numbers.

Here's a rewritten version of the function:
```
def calculate_total_order_cost(order):
    discounts = {1: 0.9, 5: 0.8, float('inf'): 0.7}
    total_cost = 0
    for item in order['items']:
        for level, discount in sorted(discounts.items()):
            if item['inventory_level'] < level:
                total_cost += item['price'] * discount
                break
    return total_cost
```
In this version, we've replaced the chained if-elif-else statements with a single loop that iterates over a dictionary of inventory levels and corresponding discounts. This reduces the cognitive complexity by making the logic more straightforward and easier to understand.

By using a dictionary to store the discounts, we've also eliminated the need for magic numbers, making the code more maintainable and flexible. Additionally, the `sorted` function ensures that the discounts are applied in the correct order, regardless of the inventory levels.

Overall, this rewritten function is more concise, readable, and easier to maintain, reducing the cognitive complexity for developers.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can start by identifying the areas that contribute to its complexity. One such area is the nested conditions within the loop. We can simplify this by introducing a separate function for calculating the discount based on the product category.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

def calculate_discount(product_category):
    if product_category == 'Electronics':
        return 0.8
    elif product_category == 'Fashion':
        return 0.9
    else:
        return 1

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    total_cost = 0
    for item in order.items:
        if item.quantity > 0:
            total_cost += item.product.price * item.quantity * calculate_discount(item.product.category)
    return total_cost

By extracting the discount calculation into a separate function, we've reduced the number of conditions within the loop, making it easier to follow and understand. This change also makes the code more modular and reusable.

Additionally, we could consider using a dictionary to map product categories to their respective discounts, which would eliminate the need for conditional statements altogether. This would further reduce the cognitive complexity of the code and make it more efficient.

For example:

discounts = {'Electronics': 0.8, 'Fashion': 0.9}

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    total_cost = 0
    for item in order.items:
        if item.quantity > 0:
            total_cost += item.product.price * item.quantity * discounts.get(item.product.category, 1)
    return total_cost

By using a dictionary to store the discounts, we've removed the need for conditional statements and made the code more concise and easier to understand.

The given code calculates the portfolio variance given a set of weights and a covariance matrix. The code can be simplified and made more readable by using the NumPy library, which provides vectorized operations. Here's a simplified version:

import numpy as np

def calculate_portfolio_variance(weights, covariance_matrix):
    return np.dot(weights.T, np.dot(covariance_matrix, weights))

This version reduces the cognitive complexity by eliminating the nested loops and using the dot product operation provided by NumPy, making the code more concise and easier to understand.

Historical context: The concept of portfolio variance was first introduced by Harry Markowitz in his 1952 paper "Portfolio Selection", which laid the foundation for modern portfolio theory. The use of covariance matrices to estimate portfolio risk was a key innovation in this field. By leveraging NumPy's vectorized operations, we can simplify the code and make it more efficient, building on the historical developments in the field of financial mathematics.

Imagine you're trying to navigate a busy highway system. The original code is like being given a complex set of directions, with many twists and turns. You have to process multiple routes (prices, discount rates, tax rates) simultaneously, making it difficult to focus on any one path.

Reducing the cognitive complexity of this code is like simplifying the driving directions. We can break the journey into smaller, more manageable segments, reducing the mental effort required to understand the code. For example, we could calculate the total cost in three separate steps, rather than juggling multiple calculations at once. This would make the code easier to follow, just like having a GPS guide you through the highway system, one turn at a time.

Here's an updated version of the code:

total_price = sum(prices)
total_discount = 1
for discount_rate in discount_rates:
    total_discount *= (1 - discount_rate)
total_tax = 1
for tax_rate in tax_rates:
    total_tax *= (1 + tax_rate)
total_cost = total_price * total_discount * total_tax
return total_cost

This revised code is like having a clear, step-by-step driving route, making it easier to comprehend and maintain.

Instead of reducing the cognitive complexity of this code, we should consider the benefits of maintaining a level of complexity that accurately reflects the complexity of the problem domain. 

This code is attempting to model a real-world scenario where the rules for calculating PMC (whatever that is) have changed over time. The if-elif-else structure accurately represents the different rules for different dates, and simplifying it could lead to a loss of transparency and clarity. 

Furthermore, simplifying this code could make it more prone to errors, as subtle changes in the rules might be overlooked or misplaced. The current structure allows the developer to easily see the different rules and how they apply to different dates.

Instead of reducing cognitive complexity, we should focus on making the code more modular, reusable, and well-commented, so that it is easier to understand and maintain in the long run. This might involve breaking down the calculate_PMC_* functions into smaller, more manageable pieces, or using a more data-driven approach to define the rules for each date range. 

By acknowledging and respecting the complexity of the problem domain, we can write code that is more robust, flexible, and maintainable. <END_RESPONSE>

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, let's break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. 

Firstly, the variable names seem to be a mix of different languages and cultures, including Greek (Ελλάς), Russian (В bulg), and Arabic (,column Unaryayan). While this may reflect the diversity of a global team, it can create confusion and hinder understanding. Consider using a standardized naming convention.

The code contains several conditional statements with unclear conditions. Let's simplify the logic by extracting explicit conditions and making them more readable. 

For instance, the first condition appears to check if the software is "YSQL". We can rename this to a more descriptive variable, such as "databaseSoftware". Similarly, the second condition seems to check for "Selectable Caroli disease module-API-Trebuchet 14". This can be broken down into simpler conditions or constants.

Here's a rewritten version of the code with simplified variable names and logic:

if (databaseSoftware == "YSQL") {
  if (isSelectableCaroliDiseaseModule()) {
    enableLongoviCompliance();
  } else if (isAres )* /**

The given code calculates the total cost of items based on their prices and quantities. It also applies a 10% discount if the total cost exceeds 1000. Here's a simplified version of the code:

```
def calculate_total_cost(prices, quantities):
    total_cost = sum(price * quantity for price, quantity in zip(prices, quantities))
    return total_cost * 0.9 if total_cost > 1000 else total_cost
```

Changes made:

1. Replaced the for loop with a list comprehension using the `zip` function to iterate over the prices and quantities simultaneously.
2. Combined the conditional statement and the return statement into a single line using a conditional expression.

These changes reduce the cognitive complexity of the code by minimizing the number of lines, making it easier to read and understand.

Imagine trying to navigate a complex highway system in an unfamiliar city. The roads are filled with lanes, exits, and intersections that can be overwhelming to understand. Similarly, the given code is like that complex highway system, with multiple variables, loops, and conditional statements that can be difficult to follow.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we need to simplify the "roadmap" by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable sections. We can start by extracting out separate functions for each distinct task, such as calculating `delta_beta` and processing `Recommendations.JSON`. Additionally, we can rename variables to be more descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention, making it easier to understand the code's intentions.

By doing so, we can transform the code from a maze-like highway system into a more straightforward and easy-to-follow route, reducing the mental effort required to understand it.

In this rewritten code, I've:

1. Used list comprehensions to simplify the iteration process and reduce nesting levels.
2. Extracted the conditions for breathable planets and rare minerals into separate, descriptive variables.
3. Replaced the `return True`/`return False` pattern with a more concise and expressive `bool()` conversion.

From a cognitive complexity reduction perspective, the provided code can be reframed through the lens of abstraction and modularity, drawing from the principles of functional programming. 

One way to approach this problem is to recognize that the code is performing two distinct functions: 1) calculating the cost with tax for each item, and 2) summing up these costs. By breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions, we can reduce the cognitive complexity.

Here's a refactored version of the code:
```
def calculate_cost_with_tax(price, tax_rate):
    return price * (1 + tax_rate/100)

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(calculate_cost_with_tax(price, tax_rate) for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))
```
This revised code adheres to the single responsibility principle, where each function has a clear, singular purpose. The cognitive complexity is reduced as the reader no longer needs to mentally dividethe tasks within a single function. 

Moreover, the use of higher-order functions like `sum` and `zip` further simplifies the code, allowing the reader to focus on the overall process rather than individual iterations. 

By applying these principles, we have reduced the cognitive complexity of the original code, making it more modular, abstract, and readable.

Be cautious when attempting to reduce cognitive complexity. While simplifying code can improve readability, it can also mask underlying issues or introduce new problems. In this case, the function `calculate_total_receipts_parsers` has a clear, single responsibility and is easy to understand. The cognitive complexity is already relatively low.

Instead of reducing complexity, consider focusing on improving the function's performance, testing, and documentation. You could also explore opportunities to leverage existing libraries or built-in functions to calculate the total parsers, such as using a list comprehension or the `sum` function with a generator expression.

Rushing to simplify code without considering the broader context can lead to Over-Engineering, which can introduce new complexities, decrease maintainability, and create tech debt. It's essential to weigh the benefits of reducing cognitive complexity against the potential risks and unintended consequences.

In this case, the existing code is already concise and readable. Perhaps the real challenge lies in understanding the surrounding codebase, acknowledged architecture patterns, and potential future requirements that may impact this function's evolution.

Remember, simplicity is a means to an end, not an end in itself. Be mindful of the trade-offs and keep the big picture in mind when refactoring code.

The provided code calculates the total cost of a transaction by summing up the prices, applying tax rates, and applying discounts. However, the code has a high cognitive complexity due to the nested loops and conditional logic.

Here's a refactored version of the code that reduces the cognitive complexity:
```
def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates, discounts):
    total_cost = sum(prices)
    for rate in tax_rates:
        total_cost *= (1 + rate / 100)
    total_cost *= (1 - (sum(discounts) / 100))
    return total_cost
```
This refactored code achieves the same result but is easier to read and understand. The main improvements are:

* Using the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total price, reducing the need for a loop.
* Simplifying the tax rate application by multiplying the total cost by a single factor, rather than iterating over each tax rate.
* Combining the discounts into a single factor, making it easier to understand the discount calculation.

The rewritten code has a lower cognitive complexity, making it more maintainable and easier to understand for developers. This is particularly important in critical applications where coding errors can have significant consequences.

Ethical consideration: By reducing the cognitive complexity of the code, we are making it more accessible to a wider range of developers, which can lead to more inclusive and diverse development teams. This can have a positive impact on the development of critical applications and promote a more equitable distribution of technical expertise.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `calculate_total_cost` function, we can apply the concept of abstraction from the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. Specifically, we can abstract away the conditional logic into a separate function, `calculate_discount`, making the original function more modular and easier to understand.

Here's the refactored code:
```
def calculate_discount(nails):
    if nails > 5:
        return 0.9
    elif nails > 2:
        return 0.85
    else:

    for item in nailed_items:

By breaking down the logic into smaller, more focused functions, we reduce the cognitive load required to understand the code, making it more maintainable and scalable. This refactoring also allows us to easily modify or extend the discount logic without affecting the overall calculation.

I understand that you want to reduce the cognitive complexity of the given code. However, I have to argue that the code itself seems to be a Frankenstein's monster of unclear requirements, mixed language syntax, and indecipherable variable names. It's akin to trying to simplify a Jackson Pollock painting byใช reputable colors - the essence of the code's complexity lies not in its syntax, but in its inherently convoluted nature. 

Reducing cognitive complexity requires a deep understanding of the code's purpose, logical flow, andΡΑational decisions. In this case, I'd argue that refactoring this code would be akin to rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic - instead, it's essential to rethink the fundamental design and requirements driving this code. A simpler code would require a significantly different implementation, with clearer variable names, more intuitive logic, and a rational design. Sadly, reducing cognitive complexity often means starting from scratch and making intentional design decisions, rather than simply syntactically simplifying an already labyrinthine codebase.

* Replacing the index-based iteration with the `zip` function, which automatically iterates over both lists in parallel, reducing the need to keep track of indices.
* Eliminating the temporary variable `total_cost` and directly returning the calculated result, which simplifies the code and reduces the number of variables to keep track of.
* Using more descriptive variable names, such as `price` and `tax_rate`, to make the code easier to understand.

Imagine you're trying to navigate a busy kitchen to make a simple salad. The original code is like having to weave through multiple counters, dodging chefs, and stopping at various stations to wash, chop, and assemble the ingredients. It's like following a complex recipe with many steps.

Reducing the cognitive complexity of this code is like streamlining the kitchen workflow. We can simplify the process by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable tasks, and using tools like pre-chopped ingredients or a salad prepper to reduce the number of steps. 

For example, we could use a list comprehension to calculate the total cost in a single line: `total_cost = sum(price * (1 + tax_rate/100) for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))`. This is like having a single, efficient workstation where all the ingredients are within easy reach, and the assembly process is straightforward.

Instead of focusing solely on reducing the cognitive complexity of this code, let's take a step back and reevaluate the underlying assumptions. This code snippet appears to be implementing a hardcoded, complicated salary adjustment logic that's tightly coupled to specific roles and departments.

Before we simplify the code, let's ask:

* Is this logic correct, or are there edge cases or exceptions that need to be handled?
* Are there other factors that influence salary adjustments, such as performance reviews, location, or years of experience?
* Would it be more maintainable to externalize this logic into a configuration file or database, rather than hardcoding it into the code?
* Could we benefit from creating a separate salary adjustment strategy interface, allowing us to easily swap out different implementations or add new ones without modifying the existing code?

* Extracted a dictionary `tax_rates` to store the category-specific tax rates, making it easy to add or modify rates in the future.
* Replaced the `if-elif-else` chain with a single expression using a dictionary's `get()` method, which returns the default value (1.05) if the item's category is not found in the dictionary.
* Used a generator expression to calculate the total cost in a single line, reducing the need for intermediate variables.

Now, the code is like a tidy kitchen. We've broken down the calculation into smaller steps, making it easier to follow and understand. We've also avoided tangling loops and calculations together, making the code more modular and maintainable. Just like how a clean kitchen makes it easier to cook, simplified code makes it easier to understand and maintain!

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 

Here is a rewritten version of the code with reduced cognitive complexity:

def calculate_complexity(code):
    if code.startswith("if "):
        return 2
    elif code.startswith("for "):
        return 3
    elif code.startswith("while "):
        return 4
    else:
        return 1

def calculate_total_complexity(codes):
    return sum(calculate_complexity(code) for code in codes)

This code achieves the same functionality as the original, but with a few key changes. First, the complexity calculation for each code snippet is extracted into its own function, which makes it easier to understand and maintain. Secondly, the total complexity is calculated using a generator expression, which is a more concise and readable way to sum up the complexities.

By breaking down the complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces, the cognitive complexity of the code is significantly reduced.

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the Benedetti–Cecchi zeal index, a ecological metric introduced in 1975 by Italian ecologists Luigi Benedetti-Cecchi and Lisandro Benedetti-Cecchi. The index quantifies the complexity of a marine ecosystem.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can simplify the variable names and refactor the calculation. Here's a refactored version:

def calculate_zeal_index(phyla, categories, orders, families, genera, species):
    zeal_index = 0
    for phylum in phyla:
        for category in categories:
            zeal_index += (orders * families * genera * species) / (phylum * category)
    return zeal_index

By using more descriptive and self-explanatory variable names, we have reduced the cognitive load required to understand the code. Additionally, the calculation is now more straightforward, making it easier to comprehend.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the total cost of items based on their prices and quantities. It also applies a 10% discount if the total cost exceeds 1000. Here's a rewritten version with reduced cognitive complexity:

def calculate_total_cost(prices, quantities):
    total_cost = sum(price * quantity for price, quantity in zip(prices, quantities))
    return total_cost * 0.9 if total_cost > 1000 else total_cost

Changes made:
1. Replaced the iterative calculation of total cost with a concise list comprehension using the `zip` function.
2. Combined the discount application into a single line using a conditional expression.

These changes improve the code's readability and simplify the logic, making it easier to understand and maintain.

The code can be simplified by reducing the number of conditional statements and extracting the common logic into a separate function. Think of it like gardening - just as a gardener would group similar plants together to simplify maintenance, we can group similar logic together to simplify the code. 

For instance, we can create a dictionary that maps item categories to their corresponding discounts. Then, we can iterate through the item quantities and calculate the total cost using this dictionary. Here's the refactored code:

def get_discount(category):
    discount_rates = {'Foo': 1, 'Bar': 0.9, 'default': 0.8}
    return discount_rates.get(category, discount_rates['default'])

def calculate_total_cost(item_quantities):
    total_cost = 0
    for item, quantity in item_quantities.items():
        total_cost += item['price'] * quantity * get_discount(item['category'])
    return total_cost

By doing so, we reduced the cognitive complexity of the code by minimizing the number of conditional statements and making the logic more modular and reusable. Just like a well-maintained garden, the code is now easier to understand and maintain!

} else if (post_status == 'published' || post_status == 'draft') {
    comments_enabled? display_comments() : hide_comments();
} else {
    disable_comments();
}

In this refactored code, we have:
- Introduced a reusable `user_has_permission` function to encapsulate the complex user role logic
- Flattened the nested conditional structure with an early return for the case where the user doesn't have permission
- Simplified the comment display logic using the ternary operator, making it easier to read and understand.

This revised code has a lower cognitive complexity, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain. <END_RESPONSE>

let showDashboard = typeofisers === "admin" || typeofusers === "moderator" || typeofusers === "user";
if (showDashboard) {
    displayDashboard();
} else {
    displayError();
}

By extracting the conditional logic into a separate variable, we've made the code more readable and easier to understand. The intent of the code is now more clear, and the conditional statement is simpler to follow.

        return calculateFlatDiscount(price, quantity);
    } else {
        throw new Error("Invalid discount type");
    }
}

By breaking down the complex logic into smaller, more focused functions, we've made the code easier to read and understand. Each function has a single responsibility, reducing cognitive complexity.

function validateUsername(username) {
    if (username.length < 3) {
        return "Username must be at least 3 characters";
    } else if (username.length > 16) {
        return "Username must be at most 16 characters";
    } else {
        return "";

function validatePassword(password) {
    if (password.length < 8) {
        return "Password must be at least 8 characters";

        return "Password must be at most 32 characters";
    } else {
        return "";

<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 
Here's a refactored version of the duplicate code to reduce cognitive complexity:

function validateInputLength(input, minLength, maxLength) {
    if (input.length < minLength) {
        return `Input must be at least ${minLength} characters`;
    } else if (input.length > maxLength) {
        return `Input must be at most ${maxLength} characters`;
    } else {
        return "";
    }
}

function validateUsername(username) {
    return validateInputLength(username, 3, 16);
}

function validatePassword(password) {
    return validateInputLength(password, 8, 32);
}

By consolidating the duplicate code into a single function, we've reduced cognitive complexity and made the code more maintainable. The intent of the validation functions is now clearer, and the code is easier to read.

const TAX_RATE = 0.08;

function calculateTax(amount) {
    return amount * TAX_RATE;

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 
Here's a refactored version of the object manipulation to reduce cognitive complexity:

let user = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 30 };
let getFullName = ({firstName, lastName}) => `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
let fullName = getFullName(user);

By extracting the logic into a separate function, we've made the code more readable and easier to understand. The intent of the code is now clearer, and the object manipulation is simpler to follow.

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The provided code calculates the total cost of an order, taking into account different types of items, discounts, and taxes. To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable functions, each with a single responsibility. Here's a refactored version:

```
def calculate_subtotal(order):
    subtotal = 0
    for item in order['items']:
        if item['type'] == 'product':
            subtotal += item['price'] * item['quantity']
        elif item['type'] == 'service':
            subtotal += item['price'] * item['duration'] / 60
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid item type")
    return subtotal

def apply_discount(subtotal, discount):
    return subtotal * (1 - discount / 100)

def calculate_taxes(cost, tax_rate):
    return cost * (tax_rate / 100)

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(order)
    cost = apply_discount(subtotal, order['discount'])
    taxes = calculate_taxes(cost, order['tax_rate'])
    return cost + taxes
```

By extracting separate functions for calculating the subtotal, applying discounts, and calculating taxes, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the original code, making it easier to understand and maintain. Each function has a clear, concise purpose, and the overall flow of the code is more modular and straightforward.

        elif market == "USA":
            total += float(item)
    return total
<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The provided code calculates the total cost of items in a list, considering different market-specific rules. To reduce the cognitive complexity, we can refactor the code as follows:

1. Extract the market-specific rules into separate functions:
```python
def calculate_jp_off_cost(item):
    return 0.1 * float(item[5:])

def calculate_jp_on_cost(item):
    return float(item[4:])

def calculate_usa_cost(item):
    return float(item)
```
2. Simplify the main calculation function using a dictionary to map market rules:
```python
def calculate_total(cost, market):
    market_rules = {
        "JPN": {
            "JPOFF": calculate_jp_off_cost,
            "JPON": calculate_jp_on_cost
        },
        "USA": calculate_usa_cost
    }
    total = 0
    for item in cost:
        if isinstance(item, dict):
            total += calculate_total(item, market)
        else:
            rule = market_rules.get(market, {}).get(item[:4])
            if rule:
                total += rule(item)
            else:
                total += float(item)
    return total
```
This refactored code reduces the cognitive complexity by:
* Extracting repetitive logic into separate functions
* Using a dictionary to map market rules instead of nested if-elif statements
* Improving code readability and maintaining the same functionality

From a cross-cultural perspective, it's essential to consider the cultural nuances in software development. For instance, in Japan, it's common to prioritize respect for authority and group harmony, which may influence the coding style and collaboration. The refactored code takes into account the market-specific rules, which might be more prominent in Japan, while also making the code more maintainable and easy to understand for developers from diverse cultural backgrounds.

Code refactoring should be done with considerations to the cultural context in which the code was originally written. It's crucial to balance the need for simplicity and readability with the cultural significance of the code and its intended audience.

Cultures with a strong collectivist orientation, like many Asian cultures, may prioritize harmony and group consensus over individual productivity. In such cases, code refactoring should focus on enhancing collaboration and reducing conflicts, rather than solely prioritizing individual efficiency.

On the other hand, cultures with a strong individualist orientation, like many Western cultures, may emphasize personal achievement and autonomy. In these cases, code refactoring can focus more on improving individual productivity and reducing cognitive complexity.

Ultimately, reducing cognitive complexity should be done with a deep understanding of the cultural context and the values that underlie the code.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Here's a refactored version of the code with reduced cognitive complexity:

def calculate_total_cost(prices, discount_percentage):
    discounted_prices = [price * (1 - discount_percentage) if price > 1000 else price for price in prices]
    return sum(discounted_prices)

I made the following changes:

1. Replaced the explicit `for` loop with a list comprehension, which simplifies the code and reduces the number of lines.
2. Extracted the calculation logic into a separate list comprehension, making it easier to understand and maintain.
3. Removed the redundant `total` variable and used the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total cost.

These changes reduce the cognitive complexity of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to understand and maintain.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `calculate_total_cost` function, we can use a more concise and readable approach. Here's a refactored version:

```
def calculate_total_cost(orders):
    return sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for order in orders for item in order['items'])
```

This revised code achieves the same result but with lower cognitive complexity. By using a generator expression within the `sum` function, we eliminate the need for an explicit `for` loop and reduce the amount of code. This makes the logic easier to understand and maintain.

Note that this refactoring also assumes that the input data is properly validated and formatted. If the data may contain errors or inconsistencies, additional error handling and validation should be implemented to ensure the function's robustness.

Ethical considerations:
When rewriting code to reduce cognitive complexity, it's essential to consider the impact on code maintainability, readability, and scalability. Overly complex code can lead to errors, bugs, and security vulnerabilities, which can have serious ethical implications. By prioritizing simplicity, clarity, and maintainability, we can create more reliable and trustworthy software that benefits both users and developers.

The provided code appears to be a complex, globally-inspired function with variables and module names drawn from various cultures and languages, including Vietnamese, Korean, Arabic, Russian, French, German, and Japanese. To reduce cognitive complexity, I'll suggest some refactoring strategies:

1. **Consistent naming conventions**: Use a consistent naming convention throughout the code, avoiding mixtures of languages and scripts.
2. **Rename ambiguous variables**: Rename variables like `Tuyet_vuong` and `먹.numberOf 컴` to descriptive, English-only names, e.g., `total_liters_distilled_water` and `number_of_components`.
3. **Extract functions**: Break down the code into smaller, more focused functions, each with a clear, concise name and purpose.
4. **Remove unused imports**: Identify and remove unused imports, such as `OkHttpClient` and `ourke.total_frmd.component_for Braun౼ risk504`.
5. **Simplify calculations**: Simplify complex numerical calculations by breaking them down into smaller, more intuitive steps.

Here is an example of how the refactored code could look:
```
def calculate_total_distilled_water():
    total_liters = get_initial_liters()
    remaining_liters = get_remaining_liters(total_liters)
    total_components = get_component_count()
    result = calculate_total Water_consumption(total_liters, remaining_liters, total_components)
    return result
```
By applying these strategies, the code becomes more readable, understandable, and maintainable, reducing cognitive complexity.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the total cost of items based on their prices and quantities. It also applies a 10% discount if the total cost exceeds 1000. Here's a rewritten version with reduced cognitive complexity:

    total_cost = sum(price * quantity for price, quantity in zip(prices, quantities))
    return total_cost * 0.9 if total_cost > 1000 else total_cost

Changes made:

1. Replaced the iterative calculation with a more concise and efficient list comprehension using the built-in `sum` function and `zip` to iterate over parallel lists.
2. Simplified the conditional discount application using a conditional expression.

The rewritten code is more concise, easier to read, and reduces the cognitive complexity by minimizing the number of variables and conditional statements.

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The prompt asks to reduce the cognitive complexity of the given code, but it's essential to consider whether the current implementation is already simple and efficient. The provided function, calculate_average, has a straightforward logic: it returns the average of the input list if it's not empty, and 0 if it is. Before simplifying the code, let's ask ourselves: 

1. Is the current implementation easy to understand for the intended audience? 
2. Are there any performance issues with the current implementation? 
3. Are there any opportunities to reduce cognitive complexity by making the code more expressive or easier to read?

Upon review, the code is already concise and easy to follow. If we're looking to reduce cognitive complexity, we might consider adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose and behavior. This would make the code more readable and easier to understand for others.

def calculate_average(numbers):
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
    
    If the list is empty, return 0.
    
    Args:
        numbers (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:

    """
    if numbers:
        return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
    else:
        return 0

By adding a docstring, we've increased the overall verbosity of the code, but we've also reduced cognitive complexity by making the code more expressive and easier to understand.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The provided code can be simplified using list comprehension. Here's a rewritten version: new_list = [i for i in range(len(lst)) if lst[i] > 5]. This eliminates the need to write an explicit loop, making it easier to understand and maintain. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 2: Refactoring nested conditionals**

<BEGIN_TEXT> if x > 5: if y > 3: print("Condition met") else: print("x is greater than 5 but y is not greater than 3") else: print("x is not greater than 5") <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The provided code has a high cognitive complexity due to the nested conditionals. We can simplify it by using a more concise and readable format. Here's the refactored code: if x > 5 and y > 3: print("Condition met") elif x > 5: print("x is greater than 5 but y is not greater than 3") else: print("x is not greater than 5"). This reduces the number of nesting levels, making it easier to understand. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 3: Simplifying a recursive function**

<BEGIN_TEXT> def factorial(n): if n == 0: return 1 else: return n * factorial(n-1) <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Recursive functions can be challenging to understand due to their recursive nature. We can simplify the provided code by converting it to an iterative approach. Here's the refactored code: def factorial(n): result = 1; for i in range(1, n+1): result *= i; return result. This replaces the recursive function call with a simple loop, making it easier to comprehend. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 4: Improving readability with functions**

<BEGIN_TEXT> a = 5; b = 3; if a > b: c = a - b else: c = b - a; print(c) <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The provided code has a high cognitive complexity due to the tight coupling of variables and calculations. We can simplify it by breaking down the logic into separate functions, each with a single responsibility. Here's the refactored code: def get_larger_value(a, b): return max(a, b); def calculate_difference(a, b): return get_larger_value(a, b) - min(a, b); print(calculate_difference(5, 3)). This improves readability and maintains modularity. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 5: Eliminating magic numbers**

<BEGIN_TEXT> if x > 42: print("x is greater than 42") <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The provided code has a high cognitive complexity due to the magic number 42. We can simplify it by replacing the magic number with a named constant. Here's the refactored code: MAX_VALUE = 42; if x > MAX_VALUE: print(f"x is greater than {MAX_VALUE}"). This increases readability by providing a clear understanding of the threshold value. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The provided code calculates the total cost of an order based on the customer type and quantity. Here's a revised version that reduces cognitive complexity:

```
def calculate_total_cost(order):
    discount_map = {
        (True, 10): 0.1,
        (True, 5): 0.05,
        (True, 0): 0,
        (False, 20): 0.15,
        (False, 10): 0.1,
        (False, 0): 0
    }
    discount_key = (order.special_customer, order.quantity)
    discount = 0
    for k, v in discount_map.items():
        if k[0] == order.special_customer and k[1] <= order.quantity:

            break
    total_cost = order.base_cost * (1 - discount)
    return total_cost + (20 if total_cost > 100 else 0)
```

Changes made to reduce cognitive complexity include:

1. Extracting the discount logic into a dictionary, making it easier to read and maintain.
2. Using a more straightforward loop to determine the discount, rather than nested if-else statements.
3. Simplifying the `total_cost` calculation by using the ternary operator to add the additional fee.

These changes make the code more modular, readable, and easier to understand.

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 
The provided code has several conditional statements that make it difficult to understand. We can simplify it by using a more organized approach. Here's a rewritten version:

def calculate_delivery_time(distance, speed):
    if distance <= 0 or speed <= 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    delivery_distances = [(500, "Same day delivery"), (1000, "Next day delivery"), (2000, "2-day delivery"), (5000, "3-day delivery")]
    for max_distance, delivery_time in delivery_distances:
        if distance < max_distance and speed > get_required_speed(max_distance):
            return delivery_time
    return "More than 3-day delivery"

def get_required_speed(distance):
    if distance == 500:
        return float('inf')
    elif distance == 1000:
        return 50
    elif distance == 2000:
        return 30
    elif distance == 5000:
        return 20
    return 0

In this version, we've separated the conditional logic into two functions, making it easier to understand and maintain. The `calculate_delivery_time` function now iterates over a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a maximum distance and a corresponding delivery time. The `get_required_speed` function returns the required speed for a given distance. This organization reduces the cognitive complexity of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The original code has a high cognitive complexity due to the nested if-else statements, which can make it challenging to understand and maintain. Here's a refactored version that reduces the cognitive complexity:

```
def handle_special_cases(input_data):
    case_mapping = {

    }

    for key, value in case_mapping.items():
        if input_data['type'] == key[0] and key[1](input_data['specific_field']):
            return value

    return 'Unknown'
```

In the refactored code, we've introduced a `case_mapping` dictionary that contains all the conditions and their corresponding outcomes. This approach reduces the cognitive complexity by:

1. Flattening the nested if-else structure, making it easier to follow the code path.
2. Decoupling the conditions and outcomes, allowing for easier addition or removal of cases.
3. Using lambdas to encapsulate the conditional logic, making it more concise and readable.

By applying these changes, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the original code, making it more maintainable and efficient to understand. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 

The provided code can be simplified by reducing the number of conditional statements and using a more object-oriented approach. Here's a refactored version:

```
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def process(self):
        processors = {

        }
        return processors.get(self.data['type'], self.process_unknown_data)()

def process_data(data):
    return DataProcessor(data).process()
```

This refactored code reduces cognitive complexity by:

1. Encapsulating the processing logic within a dedicated `DataProcessor` class.
2. Using a dictionary to map data types to processing functions, reducing the number of conditional statements.
3. Introducing a clear separation of concerns, making the code easier to maintain and extend.

By simplifying the code, we've made it easier to understand and modify, reducing the cognitive load for developers and improving overall code maintainability.

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `calculate_total_cost` function, we can break it down into smaller, more manageable parts. Here's a refactored version of the code:

```
def calculate_taxed_price(price, tax_rate):
    return price * tax_rate / (1 - tax_rate)

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(calculate_taxed_price(price, rate) for price, rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))
```

In this refactored code, we've introduced a new function `calculate_taxed_price` that computes the taxed price for a single item. This function has a very low cognitive complexity, as it only performs a simple calculation.

The `calculate_total_cost` function now uses a generator expression to calculate the total cost by summing up the taxed prices for each item. This reduces the cognitive complexity of the function by removing the need to understand the iteration and indexing logic.

By breaking the code down into smaller functions, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the overall codebase, making it easier to understand and maintain.

This refactored code reduces the cognitive complexity by eliminating the nested conditional statements and using a more declarative approach to define the payment rules. The `payment_processor` function becomes more simple and easy to understand.

While the goal of reducing cognitive complexity is understandable, it's essential to consider the potential drawbacks of over-simplification. The provided code, although lengthy, is relatively straightforward and easy to comprehend. It's possible that simplifying it could lead to a loss of explicitness, making it harder for future maintainers to understand the intent behind the code.

Instead of solely focusing on reducing cognitive complexity, it might be more beneficial to focus on improving code organization, adding meaningful variable names, and incorporating comments to explain the reasoning behind complex logic. This approach would result in code that is both easy to understand and maintain. Sometimes, "cognitive complexity" is just a euphemism for "I need to invest time in understanding the code."

Before refactoring, it's crucial to consider the tradeoffs between code conciseness and readability. Simplifying code can lead to inadvertent consequences, such as introducing bugs or making the code more prone to errors. In this case, the original code may be morelicated, but it's explicit and easy to follow, which is essential for maintaining a robust and reliable system. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
However, before we dive into reducing the cognitive complexity of this code, let's consider whether it's the right approach to optimize for cognitive complexity in the first place.

This code snippet appears to be doing a simple iteration to find an available port, which is a straightforward and intuitive process. The cognitive complexity might be inherently low due to the simplicity of the task. 

Instead of solely focusing on reducing cognitive complexity, we might want to consider other aspects such as:

* Performance: Would iterating through all available ports be efficient, especially if the list is large?
* Error handling: What if `is_port_in_use` throws an exception? How would we catch and handle it?
* Code organization: Could we extract this logic into a separate function or module for better modularity and reusability?

Once we've addressed these concerns, we can revisit the cognitive complexity and discuss potential optimizations, such as using a `next` function with a generator expression or leveraging a ` sulla_t中ached` approach.

What specific concerns or goals do you have in mind when asking to reduce the cognitive complexity of this code?

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `calculate_total_cost` function, we can break it down into simpler, more modular steps. Here's a rewritten version:

def calculate_subtotal(order):
    subtotal = 0
    for item in order:
        if item['promo'] > 0:
            subtotal += item['price'] * item['qty'] * (1 - item['promo']/100)
        else:
            subtotal += item['price'] * item['qty']
    return subtotal

def add_tax(subtotal):
    return subtotal * 1.08  # 8% tax

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(order)
    return add_tax(subtotal)

By separating the calculation of the subtotal and the addition of tax, the code becomes more readable and easier to understand. We've reduced the cognitive complexity by:
* Reducing the number of operations in each function
* Using descriptive function names to convey the purpose of each step
* Minimizing the number of variables and calculations within each function
This rewritten code is more modular, easier to test, and less prone to errors.

```

Changes made:

* Simplified variable names and function name
* Removed unnecessary nesting by returning early when the user is not found
* Used the `get` method to provide a default value for `login_attempts` and reduced the number of conditional checks
* Improved code readability by adding whitespace and using consistent indentation

These changes reduce cognitive complexity by making the code more readable, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `generate_magic_spell` function, we can simplify the logic by using a dictionary to map the ingredient categories to their corresponding spell suffixes. Here's the refactored code:

def generate_magic_spell(ingredients):
    suffixes = {'rare': ' OF THE ANCIENTS', 'uncommon': ' OF THE LAND', 'common': ' of the mortal realm'}

The refactored code eliminates the need for multiple conditional statements, making it easier to understand and maintain. The dictionary `suffixes` acts as a lookup table, providing a clear and concise way to assign the correct suffix to each ingredient based on its category.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 
To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, let's apply the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle from object-oriented design.

Firstly, the calculate_total_cost function is responsible for determining the base cost, weight surcharge, and insurance surcharge, which is a clear violation of the SRP. To fix this, we can introduce separate functions for each calculation.

Secondly, the code contains multiple conditional statements that repeat similar logic. We can refactor this using a dictionary-based approach to eliminate duplication.

Here's the refactored code:

```
SHIPPING_TYPES = {'express': 20, 'standard': 10, 'basic': 5}

def get_base_cost(shipping_details):
    return SHIPPING_TYPES.get(shipping_details['shipping_type'], 0)

def get_weight_surcharge(shipping_details):
    return 5 if shipping_details['package_weight'] > 5 else 0

def get_insurance_surcharge(shipping_details):
    return 2 if shipping_details['insured'] else 0

def calculate_total_cost(shipping_details):
    return get_base_cost(shipping_details) + get_weight_surcharge(shipping_details) + get_insurance_surcharge(shipping_details)
```

By applying these design principles, we have significantly reduced the cognitive complexity of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The cognitive complexity of the given code can be reduced by simplifying the conditional statements and extracting the discount calculation into a separate function. Here's the refactored code:

```python
def calculate_discount(category):

def calculate_total_price(order):
    return sum(item['price'] * calculate_discount(item['category']) for item in order)
```

This refactored code is easier to read and maintain, with a reduced cognitive complexity. The `calculate_discount` function directly returns the discount factor, making the calculation more explicit and reducing the number of conditional statements. Additionally, the `calculate_total_price` function uses a generator expression to calculate the total price, making it more concise and efficient. <END_RESPONSE>

Applying the principles of cognitive load theory, we can reduce the cognitive complexity of the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. One effective strategy is to extract the conditional logic into separate functions, each with a single responsibility.

Here's the refactored code:

def calculate_tax_rate(item):
    if item["type"] == "book":
        return 0.05
    elif item["type"] == "food":
        return 0.10
    elif item["type"] == "clothing":
        return 0.20
    else:
        return 0.05

def calculate_total_cost(items):
    total_cost = 0
    for item in items:
        total_cost += item["price"] * calculate_tax_rate(item)
    return total_cost

By separating the concerns of tax rate calculation and total cost calculation, we reduce the cognitive load on the reader. This makes the code more modular, easier to understand, and less prone to errors.

Furthermore, this refactoring aligns with the principles of functional decomposition, a fundamental concept in computer science. By breaking down complex functions into smaller, independent functions, we can better manage complexity and improve code maintainability.

The given code calculates TVA (Value-Added Tax) based on the country, state or region. To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can use a dictionary to map the tax rates instead of using nested if-else statements. Here's the refactored code:

def calculate_tva(amount, tax_rates):
    tax_map = {
        ('USA', 'CA'): 0.0875,
        ('USA', 'NY'): 0.08,
        ('USA', 'OTHER_STATE'): 0.06,
        ('France', 'Île-de-France'): 0.2,
        ('France', 'OTHER_REGION'): 0.1,
        ('OTHER_COUNTRY', '') : 0.05
    }
    country = tax_rates['country']
    state_or_region = tax_rates.get('state', tax_rates.get('region', ''))
    return amount * tax_map.get((country, state_or_region), 0.05)

This refactored code reduces the cognitive complexity by eliminating the need to understand the nested if-else logic. Instead, it uses a dictionary to map the tax rates, making it simpler to read and maintain. The code also handles edge cases where the tax rate is not found in the dictionary by returning a default rate of 0.05.

In this example, the response takes into account the historical context of tax rates in different countries and regions, and uses a dictionary to simplify the code. The response also provides a clear explanation of how the refactored code reduces the cognitive complexity.

From a cognitive load theory perspective, the original code snippet can be overwhelming due to its inherent complexity. One strategy to reduce cognitive complexity is to break down the code into smaller, more manageable chunks. 

Here's a revised version of the code:
```
def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    def calculate_subtotal(prices, tax_rates):
        return sum(price * tax_rate for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))

    def apply_discount(total_cost):
        return total_cost * 0.9

    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(prices, tax_rates)
    total_cost_with_discount = apply_discount(subtotal)
    return total_cost_with_discount
```
By modularizing the code, we reduce the cognitive load on the reader. Each function has a single, clear responsibility, making it easier to comprehend the overall logic. This revised code adheres to the principles of simplicity and modularity, as advocated by theories of cognitive load management.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The original code has high cognitive complexity due to the long chain of if-elif-else statements. This can be reduced by using a dictionary to map data types to their corresponding calculation functions.

Here's a refactored version of the code:
```
def process_data(data):
    calculation_functions = {
        'A': calculate_A,
        'B': calculate_B,

    if data['type'] in calculation_functions:
        return calculation_functions[data['type']](data['value'])
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid data type")
```
This version is easier to read and maintain, as it eliminates the need to read through multiple if-elif-else statements. Instead, the code uses a clear and concise dictionary lookup to determine which calculation function to use.

Additionally, if new data types need to be added in the future, it's simple to add them to the dictionary without modifying the underlying logic of the code. This reduction in cognitive complexity makes the code more efficient and easier to understand. <END_RESPONSE>

By using a lookup table, we reduce cognitive complexity. This makes it easier to maintain and update the list of tax rates. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The provided code calculates the total revenue from a list of orders. However, it can be simplified to reduce cognitive complexity. Here is a refactored version:
```
def calculate_totalRevenue(self, orders):
    return sum(order['total_amount'] for order in orders if order['order_status'] == 'shipped')
```
Changes made:

* Removed unnecessary conditional statements and replaced with a conditional expression in a generator expression.
* Eliminated redundant code by removing the `elif` and `else` clauses.
* Used the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total revenue, making the code more concise and easier to read.

Overall, the refactored code is more concise, efficient, and easier to understand, reducing cognitive complexity. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>

The code calculates the area of different shapes based on their type and dimensions. To reduce the cognitive complexity, we can break it down into smaller functions, each responsible for calculating the area of a specific shape. This way, the main function simply calls the appropriate shape-specific function.

Here's the refactored code:
```
def calculate_rectangle_area(shape):
    return shape["width"] * shape["height"]

def calculate_triangle_area(shape):
    return 0.5 * shape["base"] * shape["height"]

def calculate_circle_area(shape):
    return 3.14 * (shape["radius"] ** 2)

def calculate_area(shape):
    if isinstance(shape, dict):
        shape_type = shape.get("type")
        if shape_type == "rectangle":
            return calculate_rectangle_area(shape)
        elif shape_type == "triangle":
            return calculate_triangle_area(shape)
        elif shape_type == "circle":
            return calculate_circle_area(shape)
    else:
        return "Invalid shape"
```
This refactoring reduces cognitive complexity by:

* Breaking down the monolithic `calculate_area` function into smaller, focused functions
* Reducing the number of conditional statements and nesting
* Improving code readability and maintainability

Before attempting to reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, I'd like to clarify a few assumptions. 

Firstly, the code appears to be a mix of different programming languages and paradigms. There are hints of C-style programming, potentially Java or C++, and some unclear syntax that doesn't seem to belong to any specific language. The use of underscores in variable names is uncommon in modern coding practices, and the inconsistent indentation suggests a blend of different coding styles.

Secondly, the code includes terms that don't seem to be related to programming, such as "Denis Merlin," "football," "mountains," and "gorilla." This raises questions about the purpose and context of the code.

Lastly, there are several potential syntax errors and unclear expressions, making it difficult to discern the code's intended functionality.

Rather than simply reducing the cognitive complexity of this code, I recommend reframing the problem, identifying the target programming language and paradigm, and clarifying the requirements and context of the code. Once these aspects are clear, we can work together to create a more readable, maintainable, and efficient solution.

The cognitive complexity of the provided code can be reduced by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. Here's a refactored version:

def apply_discount(price, discount):
    return price - (price * discount / 100)

def apply_surcharge(price):

def calculate_total_cost(prices, discounts):
    total_cost = 0
    for price, discount in zip(prices, discounts):
        discounted_price = apply_discount(price, discount)
        if price > 1000:

        else:
            total_cost += discounted_price

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can consider the following simplifications:

1. Extract a dictionary to map data types to their corresponding calculation functions. This eliminates the need for multiple if-elif statements.

Here's the refactored code:
```
calc_functions = {
    'A': calc_A,
    'B': calc_B,
    'C': calc_C
}

def process_data(data):
    calc_func = calc_functions.get(data['type'])
    if calc_func:
        return calc_func(data['payload'])
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid data type')
```
This code is more concise and easier to read, as it avoids the complexity of multiple conditional statements.

Note: This response assumes that calc_A, calc_B, and calc_C are well-defined functions that take a single argument (data['payload']). If these functions have different signatures or complexities, additional simplifications may be necessary.

I understand that you want me to reduce the cognitive complexity of the given code. However, I have to challenge the assumption that the provided code is a meaningful piece of software. The code snippet appears to be a mix of different programming languages and contains many typos, which makes it difficult to decipher its intended behavior. 

Before reducing cognitive complexity, I would like to clarify the actual purpose of this code and assist in correcting the syntax and logical errors. Please provide more context or clarify what this code is supposed to achieve. 

Assuming this code is a misunderstanding and not a real code snippet, I can offer a broader response on how to reduce cognitive complexity in code in general. This might involve best practices such as code refactoring, naming conventions, and modularization. Would you like me to do that?

In this example, I'm questioning the assumption that the provided code is a valid and meaningful piece of software.

Imagine you're trying to navigate a complex recipe to bake a cake. The original recipe has many intricate steps, and it's hard to keep track of what's going on. Reducing cognitive complexity in code is like simplifying that recipe.

Take the code above, for instance. It's like having a recipe that says, "Take the prices, add the tax rates, multiply by 100, then divide by... wait, no, multiply by... uh...". It's confusing and hard to understand.

A simplified version of the code would be like rewriting the recipe to say, "Take the prices, add the tax rates, and multiply. That's it." It achieves the same result, but it's much easier to follow.

Here's a revised version of the code:
```
def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(price * (1 + tax_rate/100) for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))
```
This simplified code does the same thing as the original, but it's more concise and easier to understand. Just like the simplified recipe, it reduces cognitive complexity, making it easier to maintain and debug.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the total cost of items considering their prices and tax rates based on their states. Here's a rewritten version with reduced cognitive complexity:

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    total_cost = 0
    tax_rate_dict = {rate['state']: rate['rate'] for rate in tax_rates}
    for item in prices:

        total_cost += item['price'] * (1 + state_tax_rate / 100)
    return total_cost

Changes:
- Created a dictionary `tax_rate_dict` to store tax rates by state for efficient lookups.
- Replaced the nested loops with a dictionary lookup, reducing the complexity of the inner loop.
- Improved code readability by separating the logic into two steps.

The revised code is more concise, easier to understand, and more maintainable. It reduces cognitive complexity by minimizing the number of nested loops and improving the structure of the code.

Before reducing the cognitive complexity of the given code, I'd like to challenge the assumption that the code needs to be simplified. Sometimes, code can be complex because the problem it's trying to solve is inherently complex.

That being said, the provided code is relatively straightforward and easy to follow. It iterates over a dictionary of item quantities, looks up the price for each item, and calculates the total cost. The only potential issue is the `raise ValueError` statement, which could be replaced with a more rimicer error handling mechanism.

One possible way to simplify the code would be to use a list comprehension to reduce the number of lines and make it more concise:
`return sum(quantity * prices.get(item, 0) for item, quantity in item_quantities.items())`

However, it's debatable whether this simplified version is actually easier to understand or maintain. The original code is already quite readable and well-structured. Perhaps a better approach would be to focus on improving the naming and documentation of the function to make its intent and behavior clear.

Ultimately, the decision to simplify code should be driven by specific goals or requirements, such as improving performance or reducing bugs. Without more context, it's difficult to determine whether the code truly needs to be simplified.

2. Unnecessary quotations and concatenations: I removed unnecessary quotations and utilized f-strings for more readable and Pythonic string formatting.
3. Unclear variable names: Variable names have been updated to be more descriptive, making the code easier to understand.
4. Inconsistent indentation: The code now uses consistent four-space indentation throughout.

By applying these changes, the cognitive complexity of the code has been significantly reduced, making it more maintainable and easier to understand.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, I would suggest the following refactoring:

1. Break down the long function into smaller, more focused functions, each with a single responsibility.
2. Rename variables to make them more descriptive and concise. For example, `annotated_data` can be renamed to `annotation`, and `model_confidences` can be renamed to `confidence`.
3. Use type hints to specify the expected data types for function parameters and variables.
4. Consider using a more readable data structure, such as a dictionary or a pandas DataFrame, to store and manipulate the data.
5. Simplify the calculation of `usragentRating` by breaking it down into smaller, more understandable steps.

The cognitive complexity of this code can be reduced by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. Here's a refactored version:

def apply_discount(price, discount):
    if discount > 0:
        return price - (price * discount / 100)
    return price

def add_tax(price, tax_rate):

def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate, discount):
    price_after_discount = apply_discount(price, discount)
    return add_tax(price_after_discount, tax_rate)

This refactored code reduces cognitive complexity by introducing two new functions that each handle a specific task, making it easier to understand and debug. 

By separating the concerns of applying the discount and adding the tax, the code becomes more modular and easier to reason about. The main `calculate_total_cost` function simply orchestrates the calls to these two functions, making it more straightforward and simpler to understand.

Additionally, the code becomes more testable, as each function can be tested independently, reducing the overall complexity of the code.

From a cognitive load theory perspective, the original code snippet can be overwhelming due to its inherent complexity. One strategy to reduce cognitive complexity is to break down the code into smaller, more manageable chunks. 

Here's a revised version of the code that incorporates this principle:

def calculate_subtotal(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(price * tax_rate for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))

def calculate_total_cost(subtotal):
    return subtotal - (subtotal * 0.1)

def calculate_total_cost_with_prices_and_tax_rates(prices, tax_rates):
    subtotal = calculate_subtotal(prices, tax_rates)
    return calculate_total_cost(subtotal)

By decomposing the original function into three distinct sub-functions, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the code. Each function has a single, well-defined responsibility, making it easier to comprehend and maintain. This redesign also facilitates code reusability and testing, as each sub-function can be independently tested and modified.

Moreover, from an object-oriented programming perspective, this revised code encapsulates the calculations within specific functions, hiding the implementation details from the outer scope. This abstraction enables a more modular and scalable codebase.

The cognitive complexity of the provided code can be reduced by breaking down the conditional logic into smaller, more manageable functions. Inspired by the principle of decentralization in blockchain technology, where a single entity does not hold all the power, we can decentralize the decision-making process in our code. 

Instead of having one function that handles all the conditions, we can create separate functions for each scenario: one for calculating the total cost with the standard tax rate, and another for calculating the total cost with the reduced tax rate. This decentralized approach allows for easier comprehension and maintenance of the code.

Here's an example of how the refactored code could look:

def calculate_total_cost_with_standard_tax(price, tax_rate, coupon_amount):
    return price * (1 + tax_rate) - coupon_amount

def calculate_total_cost_with_reduced_tax(price, tax_rate, coupon_amount):
    return price * (1 + 0.05) - coupon_amount

def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate, coupon_amount):
    if price > 100 and tax_rate < 0.05:
        return calculate_total_cost_with_reduced_tax(price, tax_rate, coupon_amount)
    else:
        return calculate_total_cost_with_standard_tax(price, tax_rate, coupon_amount)

This refactors the code to reduce cognitive complexity, making it more modular and easier to understand. Just as decentralized blockchain systems promote transparency and flexibility, our refactored code promotes simplicity and maintainability.

The provided code is a good example of how cognitive complexity can prohibit understanding and maintainability. Here are a few strategies to reduce cognitive complexity: 

1. **Simplify variable and function names**: Names like `Wong`, `Paolo`, `schmidstanticpie`, and `Dav` should be replaced with more descriptive and meaningful names that follow Python's coding conventions. 

2. **Break long functions into smaller ones**: The function `calculate_totalTOKENrito` is doing multiple tasks, such as calculating a value, initializing controllers, and processing a subplot. Breaking it down into smaller functions would improve readability and reduce cognitive complexity.

3. **Use meaningful variable names and separate concerns**: Unpacking the variable `xTOKENexprornment wrinkgrantenCivilian contrンツ schmidstanticpie` into separate variables with meaningful names would make it easier to understand what each variable represents.

4. **Remove redundant information and improve indentation**: Indentation and comments should be used to organize code into logical sections and clarify execution flow. After cleaning up the code, a more simplified version of the function might look like this:

def calculate_total ReSharper(currency_expression, currency_token):
    conversion_rate = 0.1
    controller = initialise_controller(currency_token)
    plot_result = process_subplot(controller, currency_expression)
    return plot_result

By applying these strategies, the cognitive complexity of the original code is significantly reduced, making it easier to understand and maintain.

1. Renamed the function to `calculate_weighted_sum` to better reflect its purpose.
2. Used a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total, replacing the imperative loop.

These changes improve the code's readability, reduce its cognitive complexity, and make it more Pythonic. By incorporating these modifications, the code becomes more maintainable, efficient, and easier to understand.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can start by recognizing that the logic is repetitive and conditional. We can extract the common patterns and create a mapping of type and category to their corresponding multiplier values.

Here's a refactored version of the code:
```
CATEGORY_MULTIPLIERS = {
    'A': {'X': 2, 'Y': 3, 'default': 1},
    'B': {'X': 4, 'Y': 5, 'default': 1}
}

def process_data(data):
    type_multiplier = CATEGORY_MULTIPLIERS.get(data['type'], {'default': 1})
    category_multiplier = type_multiplier.get(data['categorie'], type_multiplier['default'])
    return data['value'] * category_multiplier
```
This revised code has lower cognitive complexity because it:

1. Reduces the number of conditionals and nested if-else statements.
2. Extracts the hardcoded values into a separate data structure, making it easier to maintain and update.
3. Utilizes Python's default value feature for dictionaries to handle missing keys.

By making these changes, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the code, making it more maintainable, readable, and efficient.

One way to reduce the cognitive complexity of this code is to extract the category-specific pricing logic into separate functions. This makes the code more modular and easier to understand. For example:

def get book_discount(price):
    return price * 0.95

def get_food_discount(price):
    return price * 0.90

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    total_cost = 0

        else:
            total_cost += item['price']
    return total_cost

Alternatively, we could use a dictionary to map categories to their respective discount rates, which would eliminate the need for if-elif-else blocks:

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    discounts = {'book': 0.95, 'food': 0.90}
    total_cost = 0
    for item in order:
        discount = discounts.get(item['category'], 1.0)

This response assumes that the person encountering the prompt is familiar with Python syntax and is looking to simplify the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the total cost of an item considering price, tax rate, and shipping fee. However, the tax rate is applied differently based on the price. 

To reduce the cognitive complexity, we can simplify the code by separating the tax calculation logic into a separate function. Here's the refactored code:

def calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):
    if price > 100:
        return price * tax_rate / 100
    else:
        return price * (tax_rate + 2) / 100

def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate, shipping_fee):
    total_cost = price + calculate_tax(price, tax_rate) + shipping_fee
    return total_cost

Now, the code is easier to understand and maintain as the tax calculation logic is isolated in a separate function. This separation of concerns makes the code more modular and less prone to errors.

def calculate_area_wrapper(radius):
    error = validate_radius(radius)

In this refactored code, we've broken down the logic into three functions: `validate_radius` handles input validation, `calculate_area` performs the actual calculation, and `calculate_area_wrapper` orchestrates the entire process. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand and reduces cognitive complexity. <END_RESPONSE>

The cognitive complexity of the given code can be reduced by using polymorphism. Instead of having a long if-elif-else chain, we can define an abstract method in a parent class and override it in each shape class. Here's the refactored code:

class Shape:

class Triangle(Shape):

One way to reduce the cognitive complexity of this code is to break it down into smaller, more manageable functions. 

Here's an example of how you could do it:
```
def calculate_tax_amount(price, tax_rate):

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(calculate_tax_amount(price, tax_rate) for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))
```

In this refactored code, we've extracted the calculation of the tax amount into a separate function, which makes the logic easier to understand. We've also replaced the iterative approach with a more functional one using the built-in `sum` function and a generator expression. This reduces the cognitive complexity by hiding the implementation details and making the code more declarative.

Additionally, we could consider giving more descriptive names to the variables and functions to make the code more self-explanatory. For instance, we could rename `prices` to `item_prices` and `tax_rates` to `applied_tax_rates`. This would make the code easier to read and understand.

Overall, by breaking down the code into smaller functions and using more descriptive names, we can reduce the cognitive complexity and make the code more maintainable.

I was struggling to understand the original code because it had too many moving parts. The use of indexing and manual looping made it hard to follow. By using the built-in `sum` function and a generator expression, I was able to simplify the calculation of the total cost.

        if min_income <= income <= max_income:
            return tax_rate
```

In this refactored code, we use a dictionary to store the tax brackets for each filing status. This approach makes it easier to add or modify tax brackets without changing the underlying logic. The function `calculate461TaxBracket` iterates over the tax brackets for the given filing status and returns the corresponding tax rate. This eliminates the need for multiple nested if-else statements, reducing the cognitive complexity of the code.

Moreover, this approach makes the code more modular, readable, and maintainable. It also reduces the chances of errors, as the logic is more straightforward and easier to understand.

The original code has a cognitive complexity of 3, primarily due to the two conditional statements. Here's a simplified version:

def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate):
    if price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")
    total_cost = price * (1 + tax_rate)
    return total_cost if total_cost <= 1000 else total_cost * 0.9

The changes made to reduce the cognitive complexity are:

1. Combined the calculation of `total_cost` into a single line, making it more concise and easier to read.
2. Simplified the second conditional statement by using a conditional expression, reducing the number of lines and making the logic more straightforward.

The revised code has a lower cognitive complexity of 2, making it easier to understand and maintain. <END_RESPONSE>
Here are five different scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Simple Loop**
<BEGIN_TEXT> for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { System.out.println("Hello, World!"); } <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can simply remove the loop variable and use a foreach loop instead: Arrays.asList(new String[]{"Hello, World!"}).forEach(System.out::println); Now, the code is more concise and easier to read. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 2: Complex Conditional**
<BEGIN_TEXT> if (x > 5 && y < 10 && z == 0) { doSomething(); } else if (x > 10 || y < 5) { doSomethingElse(); } else { doNothing(); } <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can break down the complex conditional logic into smaller, more manageable pieces. We can extract methods for each condition and simplify the if-else structure. For example: if (isFirstConditionMet()) { doSomething(); } else if (isSecondConditionMet()) { doSomethingElse(); } else { doNothing(); }. This way, each method has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 3: Nested Functions**

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can apply the principle of separation of concerns. We can simplify the `calculateValue` method by inlining the calculations and removing the nested function calls. For example: public int calculateValue(int x) { return (x + 5) / 2; }. This way, the method is more concise and easier to understand. Additionally, we can consider renaming the variables and methods to make them more descriptive. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 4: Recursive Function**
<BEGIN_TEXT> public int factorial(int n) { if (n == 0) return 1; else return n * factorial(n-1); } <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can convert the recursive function to an iterative approach. Recursion can be difficult to understand, especially for developers who are not familiar with it. For example: public int factorial(int n) { int result = 1; for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) { result *= i; } return result; }. This way, the code is more straightforward and easier to debug. <END_RESPONSE>

**Scenario 5: Long Method**
<BEGIN_TEXT> public void processData() { // 30 lines of code doing different operations on data } <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can apply the single responsibility principle. We can break down the long method into smaller, more focused methods, each responsible for a specific operation. For example: public void processData() { readData(); validateData(); transformData(); writeData(); }. This way, each method has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain. Additionally, we can consider extracting classes for each operation to further reduce complexity. <END_RESPONSE>

<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 

The cognitive complexity of the provided code can be reduced by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions and using boolean variables to simplify the conditional logic. Here's a refactored version of the code:

def is_eligible_for Yüksek_tax_rate(price):
    return price > 100

def calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):
    return price * tax_rate

def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate, discount, shipping_cost):
    applied_tax_rate = 0.08 if is_eligible_for_higher_tax_rate(price) else tax_rate
    total_cost = calculate_tax(price, applied_tax_rate) - discount + shipping_cost
    return total_cost

By extracting the `is_eligible_for_higher_tax_rate` and `calculate_tax` functions, we've reduced the number of conditional branches and made the code easier to read and understand. The `calculate_total_cost` function is now more focused on its primary responsibility, and the logical flow is more straightforward.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Just as a fascinating city like Tokyo simplifies its complex subway system with a color-coded map, we can reduce the cognitive complexity of this code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. One approach is to extract the different pricing rules into separate functions, each with a single responsibility. For example, we could have a function `calculate_food_cost` that takes care of pricing food items, another function `calculate_non_food_cost` for non-food items, and so on. This would make it easier to understand and modify the code without getting lost in the details. Additionally, we could consider using a dictionary to store the pricing rules, making it easier to add or remove rules as needed. By simplifying the code in this way, we can make it more maintainable and easier to understand. <END_RESPONSE>

In this example, the concept of a color-coded subway map is juxtaposed with the idea of simplifying complex code. The response draws a connection between the two, suggesting that just as a complex system can be simplified with a clear and organized map, code can be simplified by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

The provided code calculates the total cost by recursively summing up all the values in a nested dictionary. 

The cognitive complexity of this code can be reduced by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. Here's a refactored version:

def is_dict(value):
    return isinstance(value, dict)

def calculate_total(costs):
    total = 0

            total += calculate_total(value)
        else:
            total += value
    return total

Or, using Python's built-in ` collections.abc` module, we can make it even simpler:

from collections.abc import Mapping

def calculate_total(costs):
    total = 0
    for value in costs.values():
        if isinstance(value, Mapping):
            total += calculate_total(value)
        else:
            total += value

The original code snippet calculates the total cost of items with varying prices and tax rates. From a cognitive complexity perspective, this code can be overwhelming due to the density of calculations within the loop. 

Applying the principles of Runnable Specifications, a concept developed by Tom DeMarco, we can reduce the cognitive complexity of this code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. Each function should have a single responsibility and be named accordingly.

Here's the refactored code:

def apply_tax(price, tax_rate):
    return price / (1 - tax_rate)

def calculate_item_cost(price, tax_rate):
    return price * apply_tax(price, tax_rate)

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(calculate_item_cost(price, tax_rate) for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))

In this refactored code, each function has a single, well-defined responsibility, making it easier to understand and maintain. The되지emperature rectangleic complexity of the code is significantly reduced, allowing developers to focus on individual functions rather than the entire calculation.

This approach is rooted in the theoretical framework of Separation of Concerns, which states that each module or function should have a single, well-defined responsibility. By applying this principle, we can create more modular, maintainable, and efficient code.

The provided code snippet exhibits high cognitive complexity due to the repetitive structure of nested if-elif statements. This can be simplified by using dictionaries to map sorter types and configurer strategies to their corresponding functions.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

By using dictionaries, we can eliminate the need for if-elif statements and make the code more concise, readable, and maintainable. This refactoring reduces cognitive complexity, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the code.

Historical context: The concept of cognitive complexity was first introduced by Thomas McCabe in 1976. Since then, it has become a crucial metric in software development, as it directly impacts code maintainability, readability, and overall quality. By reducing cognitive complexity, developers can create more efficient, scalable, and reliable software systems.

While reducing cognitive complexity is a noble goal, it's essential to consider the context and potential trade-offs. In this case, the provided function is relatively simple and easy to understand. attempts to simplify it further might lead to:

1. Loss of readability: Over-simplification can result in longer, more convoluted code that's harder to follow. 
2. Performance degradation: Premature optimization can introduce performance bottlenecks, especially when dealing with large datasets.
3. Oversimplification of business logic: The function's conditional statements might be SSHcritical to the business requirements. Reducing cognitive complexity here could mask important aspects of the calculation.

Instead of focusing solely on reducing cognitive complexity, it's crucial to:

1. Identify the true pain points in the codebase.
2. Analyze the trade-offs between complexity, readability, and performance.
3. Implement targeted optimizations that balance these competing concerns.

Before refactoring, take a step back and ensure that the proposed changes align with the project's goals and priorities. Sometimes, the simplest code isn't always the best, and a nuanced approach is necessary.

Reducting the cognitive complexity of the given code is like being a conductor in an orchestra. Just as a conductor simplifies the complex symphony by breaking it down into individual sections, we can simplify the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.

In this code, we have a function `calculate_total_cost('{{ obfuscated }})`, which takes four parameters: `yearly_salary`, `hours_per_week`, `weeks_per_year`, and `hourly_wage`. The complexity arises from the condition that checks if `hourly_wage` is greater than 0 and returns `yearly_salary` if true, otherwise it calculates the total cost based on the other three parameters.

To reduce the cognitive complexity, we can extract the calculation logic into a separate function, say `calculate_total_hours`, and then call it from the main function. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to read and understand.

For instance, we can rewrite the code as follows:

```
def calculate_total_hours(hours_per_week, weeks_per_year):
    return hours_per_week * weeks_per_year

def calculate_total_cost(yearly_salary, hours_per_week, weeks_per_year, hourly_wage):
    if hourly_wage > 0:
        return yearly_salary
    else:
        total_hours = calculate_total_hours(hours_per_week, weeks_per_year)
        return total_hours * hourly_wage
```

By breaking down the complex code into smaller, more focused functions, we have reduced the cognitive complexity, making it easier for others (and ourselves) to understand and maintain.

This refactored code is easier to understand and maintain because each function has a single responsibility, and the logic is more straightforward. The `get_pupil_scores` function returns a list of pupil scores for a given teacher and subject, the `calculate_cumulative_score` function calculates the cumulative score for a teacher and subject, and the `calculate_cumulative_scores` function calculates the overall cumulative score.

By reducing the cognitive complexity of the code, we make it easier for developers to understand and modify the code, which reduces the likelihood of errors and improves maintainability.

```
This revised code achieves the same functionality with fewer lines of code, making it easier to understand and maintain. The `if` statement has been condensed using the `in` operator, and the `return` statements have been simplified to use the `min` function. Additionally, the code still raises a `ValueError` for unsupported shape types, ensuring that the revised code meets the original requirements while reducing cognitive complexity.

The cognitive complexity of the given code can be reduced by introducing a lookup table for customer types and their corresponding discounts. This eliminates the need for multiple conditional statements, making the code more concise and easier to understand. Here's a refactored version of the code:

def calculate_total_cost(orders):

        discount = discounts.get(order['customer_type'], discounts['default'])

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 

The provided code calculates the total cost of an item based on its price, tax rate, shipping cost, and a potential discount. However, the code has a high cognitive complexity due to the nested conditional statements and multiple calculations.

To reduce the cognitive complexity, we can simplify the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. Here's a refactored version:

```
def calculate_tax(price, tax_rate):
    return price * tax_rate

def calculate_total_cost(price, tax_rate, shipping_cost):
    total_cost = price + calculate_tax(price, tax_rate) + shipping_cost

        return total_cost - 10  # assuming a 10-unit discount
    else:
        return total_cost

In this refactored code, we've separated the tax calculation, total cost calculation, and discount application into distinct functions. This reduces the cognitive complexity by making each function simpler and more focused, making it easier to understand and maintain.

    else:
        return x * 1.25
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
While the original code has a clear logical structure, the variable names (v, w, x, y, z) make it difficult to understand what the function is supposed to do. Additionally, the magic numbers (10, 5, 2, 1.5, 1.25) are not self-explanatory.

Before attempting to reduce the cognitive complexity, I would ask: "What is this function supposed to do?" and "What do these variables and magic numbers represent?"

Assuming this function is part of a user interface framework and the variables represent different lengths or distances, I would suggest renaming the variables to be more descriptive. I would also consider creating named constants for the magic numbers with descriptive names.

The reduced cognitive complexity version might look like this:
```
def calculate_total_scrollbar_shield_value(main_component_size, secondary_component_size, scrollbar_size, container_size, zoom_level):
    if main_component_size > secondary_component_size and main_component_size > scrollbar_size:
        if zoom_level > MAX_ZOOM_THRESHOLD:
            return main_component_size * DOUBLE_WEIGHT
        else:
            return main_component_size * NORMAL_WEIGHT
    elif secondary_component_size > scrollbar_size:
        if zoom_level > MIN_ZOOM_THRESHOLD:
            return secondary_component_size * NORMAL_WEIGHT
        else:
            return secondary_component_size * REDUCED_WEIGHT
    else:
        return scrollbar_size * REDUCED_WEIGHT
```
This version is still complex, but at least it's clear what the variables and magic numbers represent. профессиassistant

Here is another example:

<BEGIN_TEXT>
for i in range(len(lst1)):
    if lst1[i] > 0:
        total += lst1[i]

        total -= lst1[i]
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Before attempting to reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, I would challenge the assumption that this is the most efficient or Pythonic way to achieve the desired result. 

The code is using an index to iterate over the list, which can be error-prone and less readable. Instead, I would suggest using a more functional approach to simplify the code.

The reduced cognitive complexity version might look like this:
```
total = sum(x if x > 0 else -x for x in lst1)
```
This version uses a generator expression to iterate over the list and apply the conditional logic, and the built-in `sum` function to calculate the total. This is not only more concise but also more efficient and easier to understand. 

However, if the goal is to reduce cognitive complexity for non-Python experts, it might be better to use an explicit loop and more descriptive variable names:
```
total_value = 0
for value in positive_and_negative_values:
    if value > 0:
        total_value += value
    else:
        total_value -= value
```
This version is more explicit and easier to understand, even for those without extensive Python knowledge.

Applying the lens of cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988) to the provided code, we can identify several sources of extraneous cognitive load that contribute to its complexity. 

The first issue is the nested conditional statements, which can lead to a "branching effect" where the reader's attention is divided between multiple possible paths of execution. To mitigate this, we can simplify the structure by introducing intermediate variables to break down the logic into more manageable chunks.

Another source of cognitive load is the use of "magic numbers" in the conditional statements (e.g. 10000, 50000, etc.). These numbers can be replaced with named constants, which would make the code more readable and reduce the burden on the reader's working memory.

Here is a refactored version of the code that addresses these issues:

TAX_RATE_LOW = 0.03
TAX_RATE_MEDIUM = 0.05
TAX_RATE_HIGH = 0.07
TAX_THRESHOLD_LOW = 10000
TAX_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM = 50000

def calculate_tax(amount, is_texas_resident):
    if is_texas_resident:
        amount Постца投資 آسیاب = max(0, amount - TAX_THRESHOLD_LOW)
        amount_tx_high = max(0, amount - TAX_THRESHOLD_MEDIUM)
        return TAX_RATE_LOW * TAX_THRESHOLD_LOW + TAX_RATE_MEDIUM * amount_tx_low + TAX_RATE_HIGH * amount_tx_high
    else:
        # similarly refactored logic for non-Texas residents

By simplifying the code structure and using named constants, we can reduce the extraneous cognitive load and make the code more accessible to readers.

Before reducing the cognitive complexity of this code, I'd like to challenge the assumption that it's necessary to simplify it. The current code is already relatively concise and focused on a specific task. 

However, if we assume that the goal is to make the code more readable and maintainable, I'd like to suggest a different approach. Instead of just reducing cognitive complexity, let's rethink the architecture and separate concerns. 

Here's an updated version:

public class GridViewSelectionHandler
{
    private readonly DatenBanks artikelData;
    private readonly hver_service wichtigService;

    public GridViewSelectionHandler(DatenBanks článekData, hver_service wichtigService)
    {
        this.artikelData = artikelData;
        this.wichtigService = wichtigService;
    }

    public void HandleGridViewSelection(GridView gridView)
    {
        if (gridView.SelectedValue is Artikel Daten)
        {
            wichtigService.SchließenContextMenu();
        }
    }
}

This approach adds more classes and methods, but it separates the concerns of handling grid view selection andSERVICE interactions. It also makes the code more modular and easier to test.

Please clarify if this meets your expectations or if there's a specific complexity metric you'd like me to focus on.

The cognitive complexity of the given code can be reduced by using a dictionary to map the categories to their corresponding discount factors. Here's the refactored code:

def calculate_total(order):
    discounts = {"Electronics": 0.8, "Toys": 0.9, "Food": 0.7}
    total = 0
    for item in order.items:
        discount = discounts.get(item.category, 1)
        total += item.price * discount
    return total

This approach eliminates the need for multiple elif statements, making the code more concise and easier to understand.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `generate_magic_spell` function, we can simplify the logic by using a dictionary to map the ingredient categories to their corresponding title cases. Here's the refactored code:

```
def generate_magic_spell(ingredients):
    title_cases = {
        'rare': lambda x: x.upper() + ' OF THE ANCIENTS',
        'uncommon': lambda x: x.title() + ' OF THE LAND',
        'common': lambda x: x.lower() + ' of the mortal realm'
    }
    return [title_cases[item['category']](item['name']) for item in ingredients]
```

This code achieves the same result but with fewer lines of code and improved readability. The dictionary `title_cases` acts as a lookup table, making it easy to add or modify title cases for different ingredient categories. The list comprehension simplifies the iteration and concatenation of ingredients.

By using a dictionary and list comprehension, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the code, making it easier to understand and maintain. Gone are the days of tedious `if-elif-else` statements, replaced by a more elegant and efficient solution!

Simplifying code complexity can be likened to untangling a messy garden hose. Imagine you're trying to water your plants, but the hose is knotted and twisted in multiple directions. You can't seem to get the water to flow smoothly. Similarly, complex code can be overwhelming and hard to follow, making it difficult to identify and fix issues.

Let's break down the `calculate_entropy` function to make it more manageable. We can start by extracting the calculation of `label_count` and `probability` into separate functions. This will make the main function more concise and easier to read.

Furthermore, we can use a list comprehension to simplify the calculation of entropy. Instead of using a for loop to iterate over each label, we can create a list of probabilities and then use the `sum` function to calculate the total entropy.

Here's the refactored code:

```
def calculate_label_count(features, label):
    return features[features.iloc[:, -1] == label].shape[0]

def calculate_probability(label_count, total_count):
    return label_count / total_count

def calculate_entropy(features, labels):
    total_count = features.shape[0]
    entropy = sum([-calculate_probability(calculate_label_count(features, label), total_count) * math.log2(calculate_probability(calculate_label_count(features, label), total_count)) for label in labels])
    return entropy

By simplifying the code, we've made it easier to understand and maintain. We've untangled the garden hose, and now the water flows smoothly! <END_RESPONSE>>());

Think of reducing cognitive complexity like simplifying a cooking recipe. Imagine you're trying to make a complex dish with many ingredients and steps. A novice cook might struggle to follow the instructions, but a seasoned chef could break it down into smaller, manageable tasks.

In the given code, the function calculate_total_cost is like a recipe with multiple ingredients (prices, quantities, taxes) and steps (looping, calculations). To reduce cognitive complexity, we can " prep" each ingredient beforehand, making the final calculation more straightforward.

One possible refactoring could be:
```
def calculate_total_cost(prices, quantities, taxes):
    def calculate_item_cost(price, quantity, tax):
        return price * quantity * (1 + tax/100)
    
    return sum(calculate_item_cost(*item) for item in zip(prices, quantities, taxes))
```
By extracting the inner calculation into a separate function, we've "prepped" the ingredients, making the main function more intuitive and easier to follow. This reduction in cognitive complexity makes the code more accessible to a wider range of developers, much like how a simplified recipe makes the dish more accessible to novice cooks. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the total cost from a prices response object. Here's a refactored version with reduced cognitive complexity:

```
def calculate_total_cost(prices_response):
    return sum(price['lp']['charges']['total'] for price in prices_response.items)
```

Changes made:

1. Simplified the function name to `calculate_total_cost` to better convey its purpose.
2. Removed the unnecessary `asier.get_prices_response(analytic_session_id)` call, as the `prices_response` object is now a function parameter.
3. Replaced the manual `for` loop with a more concise and efficient `sum` function, leveraging a generator expression to calculate the total cost.
These changes reduce the cognitive complexity of the code by making it more readable, concise, and efficient.

    total_with_tax = total * (1 + tax_rate)
    return total_with_tax 
<END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> 

The original code is calculating the total cost including tax from a list of prices. The cognitive complexity can be reduced by breaking down the code into smaller, more readable functions.

Here's a simpler version:

def calculate_total(prices):
    return sum(prices)

def apply_tax(amount, tax_rate):
    return amount * (1 + tax_rate)

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rate):
    total = calculate_total(prices)
    total_with_tax = apply_tax(total, tax_rate)
    return total_with_tax

This revised code is easier to understand because it separates the calculation of the total and the application of the tax into distinct functions. This makes each function focused on a single task, reducing cognitive complexity.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the given code, it's essential to break it down into smaller, manageable pieces and refactor it for better readability.

1. **Extract functions**: The code appears to be performing multiple tasks, such as calculating total cost, generating heatmaps, and handling user interactions. Extracting these tasks into separate functions can improve code organization and reduce complexity.
2. **Simplify variable names**: Names like `calculate_total_cost.MobilePhone`, `viewControllerCourse Interested Nebraska South`, and `eskup Kad_postsLock LINxmlComm_voltage Norm için Commorang` are quite convoluted. Renaming them to something more descriptive and concise can reduce cognitive load.
3. **Consolidate similar code**: There are several instances of repeated code, such as the `chunk.temp.loading` pattern. Consider consolidating these into a single function or a loop to reduce redundancy.
4. **Remove unnecessary comments**: The code contains numerous comments that don't seem to provide much value. Removing these can declutter the code and improve readability.
5. **Format code consistently**: The code's formatting is inconsistent, making it difficult to read. Adhere to a standard formatting convention to improve code organization.

By applying these suggestions, the code can become more modular, readable, and maintainable, ultimately reducing its cognitive complexity.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the provided code, we can apply several techniques. 

1. **Extract magic numbers and strings**: Many magic numbers and strings are used in the code, which can make it harder to understand. Extracting them into named constants can improve readability. For example, the discount rates and tax rates can be extracted into constants.

2. **Split long functions into smaller ones**: The `calculate_total_cost` function is doing many things, which can make it harder to understand. It can be split into smaller functions, each doing a specific calculation. This can also make the code more modular and reusable.

3. **Use dictionaries to replace conditional logic**: The code has many conditional statements to check the category and country. These can be replaced with dictionaries, which can make the code more concise and easier to understand.

After applying these techniques, the code could look something like this:

```
CATERGORY_BASE_PRICE_DISCOUNTS = {
    'A': (1, 0.05),

Reducing cognitive complexity of the given code involves breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts, improving readability, and simplifying decision-making logic. Here's a refactored version:

```python
def calculate_total_cost(order):
    def calculate_item_cost(item):
        if item['discount'] == 'none':
            return item['price'] * item['quantity']
        elif item['discount'] == 'percentage':
            return (item['price'] - (item['price'] * item['discount_percentage'] / 100)) * item['quantity']
        elif item['discount'] == 'fixed':
            return (item['price'] - item['discount_amount']) * item['quantity']
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid discount type")

    return sum(calculate_item_cost(item) for item in order.items)
```

In this refactored code, I've extracted the item cost calculation into a separate function, making it easier to read and understand. I've also used a generator expression to sum up the item costs, which reduces the need for an explicit loop and accumulator variable.

Ethical considerations:

* Code simplicity and readability are essential for maintainability and debugging. Improved code structure can reduce errors and bugs, ensuring more reliable software systems.
* Simplifying decision-making logic can help prevent cognitive biases and errors, leading to more accurate and transparent results.
* By breaking down complex code into smaller parts, we can promote better collaboration, communication, and knowledge sharing among team members.

Here is a refactored version of the code that reduces cognitive complexity:

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    def apply_tax(price, is_imported):
        tax = tax_rates['sales_tax']
        if is_imported:

        return price * (1 + tax)

    return sum(apply_tax(item['price'], item['category'] == 'imported') for item in prices)

In this version, I've broken down the logic into a separate function `apply_tax`, which makes it clearer what's happening to each item's price. I've also used a generator expression to calculate the total cost, which reduces the need for mutable state and makes the code more concise.

This refactoring reduces cognitive complexity by:

* Breaking down complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces
* Using descriptive variable and function names to clarify the intent of the code
* Reducing the use of mutable state, which can make code harder to understand and reason about

Overall, this refactored code is easier to read, understand, and maintain. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The provided code calculates the total price from a list of prices and also translates the total price into German, French, and Spanish. 

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can break it down into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility. Here's an example:

```
def calculate_total(prices):
  return sum(prices)

def translate_amount(amount, language_code):
  # translation logic here
  pass

def translate_total(prices, language_code):
  total = calculate_total(prices)
  return translate_amount(total, language_code)

def calculate_total_with_translations(prices):
  total = calculate_total(prices)
  german_translation = translate_total(prices, 'de')
  french_translation = translate_total(prices, 'fr')
  spanish_translation = translate_total(prices, 'es')
  return total, german_translation, french_translation, spanish_translation
```

This refactored code has several advantages over the original. It's easier to read and understand because each function has a single, well-defined responsibility. It's also more modular, so it's easier to test and maintain. Additionally, if we need to change the translation logic or the total calculation logic, we only need to modify the relevant function.

However, it's worth noting that the cognitive complexity of code can be subjective and may vary depending on individual perspectives. The best way to reduce it is often to follow principles like KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and SOLID (five design principles aimed at promoting cleaner, more maintainable code). Regular code reviews and discussions with colleagues can also help identify areas for improvement.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
The given code calculates the total Corbynista points for a player based on their buildings and mastery points. However, the function name `calculate_total_corbynista_points` does not intuitively convey its purpose, and the variable names like `Hofstadter` and `Městnosti` may be unfamiliar to non-domain experts.

To reduce cognitive complexity, we can rename the function and variables to be more descriptive:

def calculate_player_score(player):
    total_score = 0
    for building_category in player.building_categories:
        for building in building_category.buildings:
            total_score += building.mastery_points * 0.5 + building.illumination_points * 0.3

The changes made include:

* Using a list comprehension instead of a for loop to simplify the iteration over the prices and tax rates.
* Removing the need to access indices using `range(len(prices))` and instead using the `zip` function to iterate over the two lists in parallel.
* Simplifying the calculation by removing the need for the `total_cost` variable and directly returning the result of the computation.

These changes reduce the cognitive complexity of the code by making it more concise, readable, and easier to understand.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can start by breaking it down into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility. 

The function `calculate_total政治.cost` appears to be performing multiple tasks, such as iterating over data, calculating costs, and performing coordinate operations. We can extract these tasks into separate functions, for example: `get_politico_cost`, `get_art_polis_subdiscount`, `calculate_tri_index_poly`, etc. 

Additionally, variable names like `thumbups` and `Polit_costadder` can be renamed to be more descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention. 

It would also be beneficial to add comments to explain the purpose of each section of code and the logic behind the calculations. 

Lastly, consider using robust error handling and input validation to ensure the function behaves correctly in different scenarios.

By doing so, we can reduce the cognitive complexity of the code and make it more maintainable, readable, and efficient.END_RESPONSE>

The provided code calculates the total cost of an order based on the item categories and customer types. However, the cognitive complexity of this code can be reduced by simplifying the conditional statements and using a more modular approach.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    total = sum(get_tax_rate(item) * item['price'] for item in order['items'])
    return total * get_discount_rate(order['customer_type'])
```

In this revised code, we've introduced two dictionaries, `TAX_RATES` and `DISCOUNT_RATES`, which store the tax rates and discount rates, respectively. We've also added two helper functions, `get_tax_rate` and `get_discount_rate`, which simplify the conditional statements and make the code more readable. Additionally, we've used a generator expression to calculate the total cost, making the code more concise.

Reducing the cognitive complexity of this code can be achieved by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions, much like a master chef simplifies a complex recipe by separating it into individual dishes. 

Just as a chef might prepare ingredients separately before combining them, we can separate the calculation of the failure rate and the correlation analysis into their own functions. This would make the code easier to understand and debug.

For instance, we can create a `calculate_failure_rate` function that takes in `target_data` and returns the failure rate. We can then create a `calculate_correlations` function that takes in `feature_data` and `target_data` and returns a list of correlations.

By doing so, the main function would be responsible for orchestrating these individual functions, making it easier to comprehend and maintain. This is akin to a chef following a simple recipe to combine the prepared dishes, rather than trying to prepare everything at once.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the `calculate_total_costiglia` function, we can apply the concept of Separation of Concerns (SoC) from software design principles. 

SoC suggests dividing a program into distinct sections, each handling a specific responsibility. In this function, we can identify two concerns: input validation and total cost calculation. By separating these concerns, we can create a more modular and readable code.

Here's a rewritten version of the function:
```
def validate_input(quantity, price):
    if quantity <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Quantity must be a positive integer")
    if price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")

def calculate_discounted_price(quantity, price):
    discounts = [0.9, 0.85, 0.8]
    discountarinees = [10, 20, float('inf')]

            if i < discount:

I've got some good news and some bad news. The bad news is that I had to refactor the entire function to make sense of it. The good news is that I've managed to/categories the cognitive complexity of your code while maintaining itsability to craft artisanal coffee descriptions.

Here's the refactored code:

```
def make_coffee(beverage_name, caffeine_level, creamer_type):
    coffee_descriptions = {
        "latte": "steaming hot latte with ",
        "cappuccino": "perfectly balanced cappuccino with ",
        "drip brew": "classical drip brew with ",
        "default": "unknown coffee concoction with "
    }

    caffeine_levels = {
        1: "a hint of caffeine",
        2: "a moderate amount of caffeine",
        3: "an extreme amount of caffeine",
        "default": "no caffeine for you!"
    }

    creamer_types = {
        "almond": "almond",
        "soy": "soy",
        "oat": "oat",
        "default": "black"
    }

    song_lyrics = {
        "latte": "milk, milk, everywhere",
        "cappuccino": "more foam, less dreams",
        "drip brew": "the daily grind",
        "default": "utm, what's the coffee?"
    }

    beverage_name = beverage_name.lower()
    creamer_type = creamer_type.lower()

    coffee杯 = coffee_descriptions.get(beverage_name, coffee_descriptions["default"])
    coffee杯 += creamer_types.get(creamer_type, creamer_types["default"])

    song = song_lyrics.get(beverage_name, song_lyrics["default"])

    if caffeine_level == 1:
        song += "a little kick"
    elif caffeine_level == 2:
        song += "jack be nimble, jack be quick"
    elif caffeine_level == 3:
        song += "RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"
    else:
        song += "z z z..."

    return coffee杯 + " and a song in my heart: " + song
```

Now, the code is more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors. The functions of each section are clearly defined, and the logic is easier to follow. I hope this revised version brews a smile on your face!

<END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE>
Instead of reducing the cognitive complexity of this code, let's consider why it's complex in the first place. The function has a lot of magic numbers andτος seemingly unrelated variables. 

What if we rethink the design of this function? Perhaps we can create a dictionary that maps yasserUDP values to their corresponding totals. This would eliminate the need for multiple if-elif statements and make the code more readable. 

Also, what does "slapped_flag" represent? Is it a boolean value indicating whether something has been "slapped"? If so, perhaps we can rename it to something more descriptive. 

Here's an updated version of the code:

```
yasserudp_totals = {
    'yasser4 UDP': {'slapped': 42, 'unslapped': 37},
    'yasser3 UDP': {'slapped': 21, 'unslapped': 19}
}

def calculate_total(yasserUDP, is_slapped):
    if yasserUDP not in yasserudp_totals:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid yasserUDP: {yasserUDP}")
    return yasserudp_totals[yasserUDP]['slapped' if is_slapped else 'unslapped']
```

This version of the code is not only more readable but also easier to maintain and extend. 

So, instead of just reducing cognitive complexity, let's strive to write code that's intuitive, readable, and maintainable.

While reducing cognitive complexity is often a good practice, I'd like to caution that oversimplification can also have negative consequences. 

In this case, the provided function `complex_function` has a cognitive complexity of 4, which is not unreasonably high. The logic is structured in a way that makes sense for the intended output. 

Instead of trying to reduce cognitive complexity, it might be more important to focus on making the function more robust by adding input validation, handling edge cases, and improving code readability through clear variable names and comments. 

Sometimes, simplifying code too much can lead to unintended consequences, such as making it harder to understand or introducing bugs. It's important to strike a balance between simplicity and clarity.

A more valuable approach might be to consider refactoring the function to improve maintainability, scalability, and performance rather than solely focusing on reducing cognitive complexity.

The cognitive complexity of the code can be reduced by simplifying the loop and using a more Pythonic approach. Here's a refactored version:

def calculate_total_cost(prices, tax_rates):
    return sum(price * tax_rate / 100 for price, tax_rate in zip(prices, tax_rates))

In this version, we use the built-in `sum` function and a generator expression to iterate over the `prices` and `tax_rates` lists in parallel using the `zip` function. This eliminates the need for an explicit loop and makes the code more concise and readable.

The cognitive complexity is reduced because the code is now more expressive and easier to understand at a glance. The use of `sum` and `zip` reduces the mental overhead of iterating over the lists, making it clearer that the code is simply calculating a total cost.

Additionally, the refactored code is more efficient and less prone to errors, as it avoids the use of an index variable `i` and explicit loop counter. This makes the code more maintainable and scalable.

Changes made:
1. Consistent naming conventions: Renamed functions and variables to follow PEP 8 style guide.
2. Simplified function names: Shortened function names for better readability.
3. Removed redundancy: Replaced the long `if-elif-else` chain with a dictionary lookup for vendor URLs.
4. Improved function organization: Placed the `main` function at the end, which is a common pattern in Python scripts.

Considering a diverse range of cultural perspectives, it's essential to recognize that cognitive complexity can be deeply rooted in individual experiences and cultural backgrounds. Let's break down the code to make it more accessible and readable for developers from various cultural contexts.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

def calculate_total_expense(commuting_cost, entertainment_expense, grocery_expense, other_expenses):
    total_expense = commuting_cost + entertainment_expense + grocery_expense + other_expenses
    return total_expense

def calculate_taxRate(income_tax_rate, social_security_rate):

def calculate_income_after_tax(total_expense, total_tax_rate):
    total_income_after_tax = total_expense - (total_tax_rate * total_expense)
    return total_income_after_tax

By breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions, we can reduce cognitive complexity and make it more interpretable for developers from different cultural backgrounds. This approach also facilitates more efficient collaboration and knowledge sharing across global teams.

For instance, in some cultures,like Japan, attention to detail and precision are highly valued. Developers from such backgrounds might appreciate the clarity and specificity of the refactored code. On the other hand, in cultures that prioritize collective cooperation, such as in some African societies, the simplified code might facilitate more effective collaboration and feedback.

Ultimately, reducing cognitive complexity through code refactoring can lead to more inclusive and diverse software development practices that cater to the strengths of developers from different cultural backgrounds.

The given code calculates the total cost of a list of orders, taking into account different types of discounts on each item. To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can break it down into smaller functions, each with a single responsibility.

For example, we can create a separate function to calculate the discounted price of an item, which would reduce the nesting of conditional statements and make the code easier to understand:

```
def calculate_discounted_price(item):
    if item['discount'] == 'percentage':
        return item['price'] - (item['price'] * (item['discount_amount'] / 100))
    elif item['discount'] == 'fixed_amount':
        return item['price'] - item['discount_amount']

To reduce the cognitive complexity of the given code, we can apply the theoretical framework of Kolmogorov complexity, which measures the complexity of an object as the length of the shortest program that can generate it. 

In this context, we can simplify the code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. This reduction in complexity can be achieved through functional decomposition, a fundamental concept in Kolmogorov complexity theory.

Here's a refactored version of the code:

def calculate_taxed_price(item, tax_rate):
    return item['price'] * (1 + tax_rate['rate'] / 100)

def get_tax_rate(prices, tax_rates, item):
    for tax_rate in tax_rates:

The provided code calculates the total cost of an order, taking into account taxable items and their corresponding tax rates. To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can refactor it to make it more readable and modular.

Here's a refactored version:
```
def calculate_total_cost(order):
    def calculate_item_cost(item):
        if item['is_taxable']:
            return item['price'] * item['quantity'] * 1.08
        else:
            return item['price'] * item['quantity']

    return sum(calculate_item_cost(item) for item in order)
```
In this refactored code, I've introduced a helper function `calculate_item_cost` that calculates the cost of a single item, taking into account its tax status. This makes the main function `calculate_total_cost` more concise and easier to read, as it simply sums up the costs of individual items.

By breaking down the complexity of the original code into smaller, more manageable pieces, I've reduced the cognitive load required to understand and maintain it.

The cognitive complexity of the given code can be reduced by breaking down the logic into smaller, more manageable functions. Here's a refactored version:

The cognitive complexity of the code can be reduced by simplifying the conditional statements and using a more concise syntax. Here's a refactored version:

def calculate_total_cost(order):
    tax_rates = {'electronic': 1.08, 'book': 1.03}
    total = sum(item['price'] * (tax_rates.get(item['category'], 1.05) for item in order['items']))
    return total

Changes made:

* Extracted a dictionary `tax_rates` to store the category-specific tax rates, making it easy to add or modify rates in the future.
* Replaced the `if-elif-else` chain with a single expression using a dictionary's `get()` method, which returns the default value (1.05) if the item's category is not found in the dictionary.
* Used a generator expression to calculate the total cost in a single line, reducing the need for intermediate variables.

These changes reduce the cognitive complexity by eliminating the need to follow a chain of conditional statements and making the code more concise and expressive.

To reduce the cognitive complexity of this code, we can start by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions. 

The code currently has two main tasks: calculating the total price and applying a discount if the total exceeds a certain threshold. Let's separate these tasks into two functions.

Here's a refactored version of the code:
```
def calculate_total(prices):
    return sum(prices)

def apply_discount(total):
    if total > 100:
        return total * 0.9
    return total

# Example usage:
prices = [...]  # assume some prices list
total = calculate_total(prices)
final_total = apply_discount(total)
```
By separating the tasks into smaller functions, we've reduced the cognitive complexity of the original code. Each function now has a single, clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

    breathable_planets = [planet for system in star_systems for planet in system['planets'] if planet['atmosphere'] == 'breathable' and 10 < planet['temperature'] < 30]
    rare_minerals = [resource for planet in breathable_planets for resource in planet['resources'] if resource['type'] == 'mineral' and resource['rarity'] == 'rare']
    return bool(rare_minerals)
```

Changes made:

1. Introduced list comprehensions to simplify iteration and filtering.
2. Extracted filtering conditions into separate assignments, improving readability.
3. Replaced nested `if` statements with concise conditional expressions.
4. Simplified the return statement using the `bool()` function.

These changes reduce cognitive complexity by:

* Minimizing indentation levels
* Breaking down complex logic into smaller, more manageable pieces
* Using descriptive variable names to aid understanding
* Eliminating unnecessary nesting and conditional statements

The resulting code is more concise, efficient, and easier to comprehend.

From a global perspective, this refactoring exercise highlights the importance of clear and concise code in cross-cultural collaborations. By breaking down complex logic into smaller, more readable functions, developers from diverse cultural backgrounds can more easily understand and contribute to the codebase. This is particularly important in international teams where language barriers and cultural nuances can affect communication.

In this revised code, a dictionary 'taxes' is used to map categories to their corresponding tax rates. The tax rate for each item is then retrieved from the dictionary using the get() method, which returns the default value (1.05) if the category is not found in the dictionary. This eliminates the need for multiple conditional statements, making the code easier to read and understand.
