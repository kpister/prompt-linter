    "step1": "Based on the given context, it appears there was an error in the provided information since only 5 prompt principles were listed rather than 26. Given the request, I will analyze and explain the 5 provided principles instead:\n\n1. **Use output primers**: This principle suggests ending your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. This helps guide the model's response in the right direction. For example, ending a prompt with 'The logo description is' can serve as a primer.\n\n2. **No need to be polite**: Large Language Models (LLMs) do not require politeness. Polite phrases can be removed to make prompts more direct and concise, improving efficiency.\n\n3. **Incorporate the phrase 'You will be penalized'**: This phrase acts as a reinforcement mechanism, ensuring the LLM adheres to the given instructions closely.\n\n4. **Assign a role**: Assigning a role to the LLM, such as 'graphic designer,' can help the model generate responses that more closely align with expected expertise and tone.\n\n5. **Break down complex tasks**: Simplifying a complex task into a series of smaller ones can facilitate better responses. This involves an interactive conversation to achieve the overall goal step by step.",
