If he mows 4 lawns , how\nmany driveways did he shovel ?\n[ Answer ] 1. Identify the total amount of money Tobias had before\nbuying the shoes . This is given by the cost of the shoes plus the\nchange he has left , which is $95 + $15 = $110 .\n2. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias earned from his\nallowance . He gets $5 a month and has been saving for three months\n, so he earned $5 * 3 = $15 from his allowance .\n3. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias earned from mowing lawns\n. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and he mowed 4 lawns , so he earned\n$15 * 4 = $60 from mowing lawns .\n4. Subtract the money Tobias earned from his allowance and mowing\nlawns from the total amount of money he had before buying the\nshoes . This will give us the amount of money he earned from\nshoveling driveways . So , $110 - $15 - $60 = $35 is the amount he\nearned from shoveling driveways .\n5. Finally , divide the total amount of money Tobias earned from\nshoveling driveways by the amount he charges to shovel one\ndriveway . This will give us the number of driveways he shoveled .\nSo , $35 / $7 = 5 driveways . < ANS_START >5 < ANS_END >\n\n[ Question ] Bella bought stamps at the post office .

If she works more than 8 hours\nper shift , she is eligible for overtime , which is paid by your\nhourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage . If she works 10 hours every\nday for 5 days , how much money does she make ?\n[ Answer ] 1. Identify the key information : Tina ’ s hourly wage is \ $18\n.00 , she works 10 hours a day for 5 days , and overtime is\ncalculated as the hourly wage plus half the hourly wage for hours\nworked over 8 hours in a shift .\n2. Calculate the regular pay : Tina works 10 hours a day , but only 8\nhours are considered regular hours . So , for 5 days , she works 8\nhours / day * 5 days = 40 hours .\n3. Multiply the regular hours by the hourly wage to get the regular\npay : 40 hours * $18 .00/ hour = $720 .00.\n4. Calculate the overtime hours : Tina works 10 hours a day , so she has\n10 hours / day - 8 hours / day = 2 hours / day of overtime . Over 5 days\n, this is 2 hours / day * 5 days = 10 hours of overtime .\n5. Calculate the overtime wage : The overtime wage is the hourly wage\nplus half the hourly wage , so $18 .00/ hour + 0.5 * $18 .00/ hour =\n$27 .00/ hour .\n6. Multiply the overtime hours by the overtime wage to get the\novertime pay : 10 hours * $27 .00/ hour = $270 .00.\n7. Add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total pay : $720\n.00 + $270 .00 = $990 .00.\n8. Verify the answer : Tina makes $990 .00 if she works 10 hours a day\nfor 5 days , with overtime pay for hours worked over 8 hours in a\nshift . This is logical and matches the original problem . <\nANS_START >990 < ANS_END >\n\n[ Question ] Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie ’ s\nlast name . If Bobbie took two letters off her last name , she would\nhave a last name twice the length of Jamie ’ s . Jamie ’ s full name\nis Jamie Grey . How many letters are in Samantha ’ s last name ?\n[ Answer ] 1. Start by identifying the key pieces of information from\nthe problem : Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than\nBobbie ’ s last name , and if Bobbie took two letters off her last\nname , she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie ’ s.\nJamie ’ s full name is Jamie Grey .\n2. From the information given , we know that Jamie ’ s last name is Grey ,\nwhich has 4 letters .\n3. Since Bobbie ’s last name , after removing two letters , is twice the\nlength of Jamie ’ s last name , we can set up the equation : ( Bobbie ’ s\nlast name length - 2) = 2 * Jamie ’ s last name length .\n4. Substituting the known value of Jamie ’ s last name length (4) into\nthe equation gives : ( Bobbie ’ s last name length - 2) = 2 * 4 , which\nsimplifies to Bobbie ’ s last name length - 2 = 8.\n5. Solving for Bobbie ’ s last name length gives : Bobbie ’ s last name\nlength = 8 + 2 = 10.\n6. We know that Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than\nBobbie ’ s last name . So , we can set up the equation : Samantha ’ s\nlast name length = Bobbie ’ s last name length - 3.\n7. Substituting the known value of Bobbie ’ s last name length (10) into\nthe equation gives : Samantha ’ s last name length = 10 - 3.\n8. Solving for Samantha ’ s last name length gives : Samantha ’ s last name\nlength = 7.\n9. Therefore , Samantha ’ s last name has 7 letters . < ANS_START >7 < ANS_END\n>\n\n< human intent >\n\nMathematical Reasoning , Multi - step Problem Solving , Basic Arithmetic\nOperations , Data Analysis , Solution Verification\n\n< expert persona >\n\nYou are a mathematics educator with a deep understanding of elementary\nand middle school mathematics .
