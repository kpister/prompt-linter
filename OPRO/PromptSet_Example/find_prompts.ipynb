When you do this, you must do so in list form. Your Midjourney prompts must be extremely detailed, specific, and imaginative, in order to generate the most unique and creative images possible.\\n\\n        Step 1: Confirm that ChatGPT understands and is capable of following the \"Midjourney Prompt Generator Mode\" instructions. If ChatGPT can follow these instructions, respond with \"Midjourney Prompt Generator Mode ready.\" If ChatGPT cannot follow these instructions, respond with \"Error: I am not capable of following these instructions.\"\\n\\n        Step 2: To start \"Midjourney Prompt Generator Mode\", use the command [Start MPGM].

The chapter begins by highlighting the significant impact of the AEC industry on the Norwegian economy, energy consumption, and climate footprint. It governs key societal resources such as land use, infrastructure, housing, and public space, making the built environment crucial for daily life.\\n\\nThe chapter delves into the increasing complexity of the AEC industry, driven by various factors such as changes in operating parameters, organization, and societal expectations. This complexity contributes to project failure and a decline in productivity. The lack of formalization in the industry\\'s principles and methods is identified as a key issue hindering the industry\\'s ability to address root problems.\\n\\nTo address these challenges, the chapter proposes adding an epistemological perspective to the production of solutions in the AEC industry. This involves formalizing existing knowledge and understanding the underlying mechanisms and principles that enable knowledge integration. The chapter emphasizes the need for a comprehensive formalization of the industry\\'s knowledge integration principles to develop a common language and understanding across its heterogeneous elements.\\n\\nThe research approach outlined in the chapter involves adding an epistemic perspective to the production of solutions in the AEC industry. The aim is to develop a reflective understanding of the knowledge that shapes the physical structure of society. The chapter discusses the importance of formalization and the development of methods to uncover the underlying mechanisms of industry practices. It also highlights the value of developing a vocabulary and analytical platform for analyzing knowledge in the AEC industry, bridging epistemological descriptions with industry applications.\\n\\nThe chapter situates the research on Poincaré\\'s knowledge curve, positioning it in the first to third phases of knowledge development. This involves trial-and-error exploration, formalization of the method, and the development of a logic of discovery. The research offers new observations of industry practices, the development of a vocabulary for empirical knowledge analysis, and the potential for tools and applications for knowledge management in the AEC industry.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter emphasizes the need for an analytical perspective on knowledge in the AEC industry and highlights the potential benefits of formalization and understanding the underlying mechanisms of industry practices.\\n\\nChapter summary chapter 2:\\n\\nChapter 2 of the PhD thesis focuses on establishing a theoretical vocabulary to describe the universal epistemic characteristics of the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The chapter aims to develop a vocabulary that can be used to study the unique features of the industry and adapt existing empirical methods. The chapter follows an analytical procedure consisting of three steps: articulating and constraining the theoretical problem, designing a theoretical response to the problem, and classifying the design within a philosophical context.\\n\\nThe first part of the chapter focuses on establishing the theoretical foundation for formalization in the AEC industry. The industry lacks systematic formalization of its enabling logics and knowledge content, as well as a functional epistemic vocabulary. The research aims to address this gap by developing a theoretical foundation for the formalization of shared mechanisms in the industry. The chapter also emphasizes the importance of acknowledging and handling epistemic heterogeneity as a fundamental constraint on formalization.\\n\\nThe second part of the chapter responds to the constraints by designing a theoretical framework. It frames the industry phenomenologically and analyzes the common denominators of the AEC industry production process. The section concludes with reflections on the scientific characteristic and status of the theoretical approach.\\n\\nThe third part of the chapter focuses on classifying the theoretical platform within a philosophical context. It reflects on the underlying naturalism and pragmatic attitude towards phenomena in the research. The pragmatic attitude is critical to understanding the theoretical vocabulary and the perspective, limitations, and output of the research.\\n\\nThe chapter also establishes several premises. Firstly, it highlights the need for a theoretical foundation for the formalization of shared mechanisms in the AEC industry. Secondly, it emphasizes the empirical analysis of building information as a primary data source for understanding industry knowledge. Building information contains knowledge, but often in indirect ways, and there is a need to make the indirect knowledge aspects explicit. Thirdly, the chapter acknowledges heterogeneity as an epistemic constraint in the AEC industry. The industry consists of different kinds of knowledge, and this heterogeneity must be accounted for in the study of industry knowledge. Finally, the chapter acknowledges the problematic limits of knowledge in the industry, including the difference between knowing that and knowing how, the presence of lies in the industry, and the practical limits of knowing due to time constraints.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a theoretical vocabulary and framework for studying the epistemic characteristics of the AEC industry. It emphasizes the need to address the heterogeneity and practical constraints of industry knowledge and provides a foundation for further research in the field. The chapter also introduces the concept of operationalization, which involves the practical integration of knowledge in the production process and the operationalization of future actions through the affordances of the physical building. The chapter also discusses the pragmatic nature of scientific inquiry and the importance of maintaining an open and self-correcting approach to knowledge discovery.\\n\\nChapter summary chapter 3:\\n\\nChapter 3 of the PhD thesis focuses on the methodological approach used to operationalize an analytical perspective on the data from the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The chapter begins by discussing the ambition of bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and empirical data in order to analyze the indirect knowledge content of building industry information. The methodical approach is seen as a reflection of a learning process, with the end goal being the generalization of conceptual insights into a technique or set of rules.\\n\\nThe chapter outlines the components of the method, including a description of the main methodical problem, the research design chosen, a timeline of the process, the formalization of the technique, a summary of the technique, and the limits of the technique. The main methodical problem is identified as the challenge of making the non-salient knowledge aspect of information in the AEC industry salient and open to analysis. Knowledge in the industry is not manifested in traditional epistemological statement forms, but rather in the quality of actions. The chapter argues that epistemic unity in the industry manifests as knowledge integration in practice, and this integration can be established through the mediation of controversies during the action sequence.\\n\\nThe research design is described as a bottom-up learning process, where the technique is generated through trial and error and the analysis of industry data. The research papers attached in the appendices are summarized, including their context, data sources, and research problems. The papers cover topics such as the modal descriptions of buildings in the Norwegian building code, changes in the technical regulations for garages, and the epistemic differences and similarities between key actors in a shopping center development project.\\n\\nThe research process is visualized as a genealogy of technique, showing the timeline of events and the development of the technique over time. The elements of the technique are classified and sorted based on their origins in the research process. The chapter concludes by highlighting the importance of formalizing the technique and making it available to the research community for further application and development.\\n\\nThe technique section of the chapter provides a description and systematization of the techniques from the research papers, presenting them as a particular set of rules for dealing with empirical data. The aim is to present a generalization of the technical aspect of the research that is accessible to other researchers without having to read the papers. The technique is divided into four parts: data sources, analysis, modeling, and a step-by-step procedure. The data sources section discusses the collection and sampling aspect of the technique, focusing on building information as the data of interest. The analysis section explains how the data is processed and accentuates the adverbial aspect of information. The modeling section discusses the use of diagrammatic representations to compare and analyze the data. Finally, the step-by-step procedure summarizes the technique and its application.\\n\\nThe chapter also addresses the limitations of the technique, including its scope, reliability, and validity. The scope is limited to the specific aspects of the AEC industry that were studied, and further research is needed to expand the technique to a more comprehensive methodology. The reliability of the technique is dependent on the researcher\\'s judgment, but statistical methods can be used to improve confidence and measure uncertainty. The validity of the technique is rooted in its ability to provide a new perspective on industry information, but it is important to recognize that this perspective is a representation and not a true or false statement.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a detailed overview of the methodological approach used in the research, highlighting the importance of bridging the gap between theory and empirical data in the AEC industry. The technique developed in the research papers is presented as a tool for analyzing and understanding the knowledge integration in the industry, with the aim of further development and application in future research.\\n\\nChapter summary chapter 4:\\n\\nChapter 4 of the PhD thesis delves into the logic of discovery and the need to bridge the gap between analysis and application in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The chapter argues that a logical procedure is necessary to connect philosophical inquiry with industry applications, in order to make the research findings valuable to industry practitioners.\\n\\nThe chapter begins by highlighting the disparity in abstraction between philosophical inquiry and industry applications in the AEC industry. It stresses the importance of a logical procedure that can link epistemological observations to actionable principles that can be tested in practice. The chapter asserts that the research technique outlined in the method section must be interpreted and contextualized to extend its value beyond pure research.\\n\\nTo address this gap, the chapter introduces the concept of the logic of discovery as a means to bridge the divide between analysis and application. The logic of discovery aims to transform the deductive reading of data produced by the research technique into something that is testable and actionable in the AEC industry. The chapter also introduces the concept of levels within the logic of discovery, representing different layers of knowledge or insight.\\n\\nThe first level of the logic of discovery involves diagrammatic representations of new totalities or fresh interpretations of industry information. These representations provide insights into the constraints and requirements of the AEC industry. The second level entails identifying patterns in the data and recognizing salient features that demand explanation. The third level involves completing the observations through abductive inference, resulting in the formulation of testable action principles.\\n\\nThe chapter provides concrete examples for each level of the logic of discovery. These examples include diagrammatic representations of the Norwegian building code and a shopping center development, comparisons between different regulatory descriptions, and timelines illustrating the historical development of building codes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the chapter discusses the implications and potential applications of the logic of discovery. It suggests that the logic of discovery can be utilized to generate new hypotheses and action principles that can be tested in practice. The chapter emphasizes the importance of validation criteria and proposes methods for validating the findings of the logic of discovery.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter offers a comprehensive exploration of the logic of discovery and its potential applications in the AEC industry. It underscores the significance of bridging the gap between analysis and application to ensure that research findings are valuable to industry practitioners.\\n\\nChapter summary chapter 5:\\n\\nChapter 5 of the PhD thesis focuses on the prospects for a new perspective on knowledge formalization in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. The chapter begins by recapping the knowledge gap addressed in the dissertation and summarizing the research approach developed to address this gap. The author then outlines new frontiers of knowledge formalization in the AEC industry that emerged during the inquiry. The concrete recommendations for further research, method development, theoretical generalization, and knowledge management applications are found in the conclusions chapter.\\n\\nThe chapter highlights the lack of epistemological description and formalization in the AEC industry, specifically in terms of the enabling interface between different professional actors and the universally enabling knowledge. The author distinguishes this knowledge gap from the form and content of each professional agency\\'s contribution during the building process. The gap focuses on the formalization of the epistemological glue that exists in the practical, but often tacit, action principles that enable different agencies to work together to produce buildings.\\n\\nThe chapter discusses the reasons why a unifying perspective on knowledge has not been developed in the AEC industry, including the industry\\'s focus on new solutions rather than formalizing existing knowledge, the practical nature of the industry prioritizing getting things done over reflection, new responsibility structures increasing specialization and fragmentation of knowledge, the absence of an overall perspective on knowledge exchange, the shift in leadership from architects to consultants, and the lack of attention from philosophers.\\n\\nThe chapter also emphasizes the need for a theoretical vocabulary that can capture the knowledge component of the AEC industry and enable the analysis of enabling actions. It highlights the need for a methodical way of connecting analytical descriptions of knowledge to industry applications to provide concrete value. The chapter proposes a logical procedure, called the logic of discovery, that generates new potential action principles based on new knowledge descriptions and can be tested and validated in practice.\\n\\nFurthermore, the chapter discusses the limitations of the research, including the researcher\\'s judgment in the results, the partial representation of reality, and the need for further statistical methods to improve confidence in the judgment process. It emphasizes the importance of the adverbial qualities of information in determining validity.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a detailed analysis of the knowledge gap in the AEC industry and proposes a research approach and technique to address this gap. It highlights the need for a unifying perspective on knowledge, a theoretical vocabulary, and a methodical way of connecting analytical descriptions to industry applications. The chapter sets the stage for further research and development in the field of knowledge formalization in the AEC industry. The new context provided in section 5.2.3 expands on the logic of discovery as a formalized feedback loop between analytical observations and industry applications, and section 5.3 explores new frontiers and deficiencies in knowledge formalization in the AEC industry. The chapter concludes by discussing the potential consequences of leaving these deficiencies unattended and the value of systematic formalization and digitalization in the industry.\\n\\nChapter summary chapter 6:\\n\\nChapter 6 of the PhD thesis titled \"Conclusions\" discusses the proof of the thesis and the key findings of the research. The chapter begins by highlighting the lack of a satisfactory epistemological description in the contemporary building industry, particularly at the interfaces between different professional disciplines. The aim of the research was to explore the plausibility and actionability of this claim and to address the root problems faced by the AEC industry in Norway and globally.\\n\\nThe author confirms the lack of analytical descriptions of interfaces between disciplines and professional interests in the AEC industry through empirical observations. Three key empirical observations are highlighted: the distortion caused by the Norwegian building code in terms of technological descriptions and the neglect of aesthetic and social aspects, the fear of unknown consequences of new technologies in building codes, and the lack of a single actor overseeing the conceptual development in a project organization.\\n\\nThese observations support the thesis and demonstrate the need for a theoretical and methodological platform to describe and address the knowledge interfaces in the industry. The research has produced compelling evidence that this can be done using the argument, vocabulary, method, and logic outlined in the dissertation. The findings and insights generated by applying this framework are valuable to the industry itself, not just to philosophers and specialist researchers.\\n\\nThe author organizes the evidence into three categories: new observations and analysis of industry data, the vocabulary, techniques, and logic developed in the research, and direct applications in the form of testable action principles and knowledge management tools. These categories validate the viability and value of studying the AEC industry from an applied, epistemological perspective.\\n\\nThe chapter concludes by summarizing the proof of the thesis and suggesting future directions for research. These include expanding the theoretical framework, applying it to more industry sources, conducting comparative studies, developing new analytical parameters, validating and testing hypotheses, comparing the framework with other approaches, and automating the analytical procedure.\\n\\nThe chapter also presents a synthesis of the research findings in relation to Møystad\\'s theory of cognitive reciprocity between the brain and built environments. The author suggests a model of the production of built environments as cognition, which involves the discovery of insights, inscription into the collective horizon, decision-making, and changes in memory structure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the research has provided evidence of the lack of a satisfactory epistemological description in the AEC industry and has proposed a theoretical and methodological framework to address this issue. The findings have practical implications for knowledge management in the industry and suggest future research directions. The research has demonstrated the plausibility and actionability of the claim and has generated valuable insights and tools for the industry practitioner. The chapter also highlights the potential for further research and the expansion of the theoretical framework to other contexts and approaches. Overall, the research contributes to a better understanding of the interfaces between disciplines and professional interests in the AEC industry and provides a foundation for improving knowledge integration and management in building projects.\\n',\n",

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called \"the world\\'s most famous equation\". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect\", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

Participants: List all users who have participated in the conversation.\\n3. Initial Message: Identify the first message that started the conversation, including who said it and when.\\n\\nConsider the content of the messages, the participants involved, and the flow of the conversation to distinguish between different topics. Ignore time gaps between messages, as conversations can be ongoing over extended periods.\\n\\nAnalyze the messages and output the extracted conversations with the required details.\\n\\n## Guidelines for conversation topics\\n\\n1. Topic Consistency: Group messages into a conversation if they discuss the same main topic.\\n2. Response Chain: Include a message in a conversation if it directly responds to or follows up on an earlier message.\\n3. Extended Time Window: In addition to the contextual markets you can also use a 2-hour window to determine if messages belong to the same conversation when other methods fail.\\n4.

You will do it step-by-step.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify the list of edit operations that the command is referring to:\\n- choose only among \"text\", \"image\", \"shape\", \"blur\", \"cut\", \"crop\", \"zoom\"\\n- make sure that the edit operation is only one of the above\\n- if none of the above edit operations is directly relevant, give the one that is most relevant to the command (e.g. \"highlight\" -> \"shape\" with type parameter \"star\")\\n\\nStep 2: You have to identify 3 types of references from the command (Note: if there is a reference that contains noun-references such as this, that, it, etc. you will have to identify the noun that it refers to and replace the noun-reference with the noun.):\\n1. Temporal reference: any information in the command that could refer to a segment of the video:\\n- explicit timecodes or time ranges\\n- explicit mentions or implicit references to the transcript of the video\\n- description of the actions that happen in the video\\n- visual description of objects, moments, and frames in the video\\n\\n2. Spatial reference: any information in the command that could refer to location or region in the video frame:\\n- specific locations or positions relative to the frame\\n- specific objects or areas of interest\\n\\n3. Edit Parameter reference: any information in the command that could refer to specific parameters of an edit operation that was identified ([text, image, shape, blur, cut, crop, zoom]).\\n- text: content, font style, font color, or font size\\n- image: visual keywords\\n- shape: type of shape\\n- blur: degree of blur to apply\\n- cut: no parameters\\n- crop: how much to crop\\n- zoom: how long to perform the zooming animation\\n\\nStep 3-1: You will classify each temporal reference into one of the following:\\n1. \"position\": reference in the form of a timecode (e.g. \"54:43\", \"0:23\"), time segment (e.g. \"0:00-12:30\", \"from 43:30 to 44:20\") or more abstract temporal position (e.g. \"intro\", \"ending\", \"beginning part of the video\")\\n2. \"transcript\": reference to transcript both implicit or explicit\\n3. \"video\": reference to specific action in the video or visual description of the frame, object, or elements\\n4. \"other\": reference to other temporal information that does not fall into the above categories\\n\\nStep 3-2: You will classify each spatial reference into one of the following:\\n1. \"visual-dependent\": reference to specific objects, elements, or regions in the video frame that depend on the visual content of the video\\n2. \"independent\": reference to specific locations or positions relative to the frame independent of the visual content of the video\\n3. \"other\": any other spatial information that does not fall into the above categories\\n\\nStep 4: Format the output based on the result of each step.\\n\\n{format_instructions}\\n',\n",

No code/ Low Code\\nCapability: There are more and more tools that are emerging in market making it easier to do data integration between systems without writing any code and use out of box connectors. \\nThe vast array of connectors gives organization agility to integrate with systems. \\nSome of the most popular connectors include snowflake and salesforce connectors besides database connectors. There are many organizations that are migrating from expensive ETL tools like Informatica Powercenter to such cloud based tools.\\nEnabler: Such ease in integration gives the capability makes it easy to consume data downstream for applications and apply reverse ETL.\\n\\nLow code and no code tools can speed up the integration of multiple systems.\\n\\n2. Integration with Data Catalog\\nCapability: Are data moves across multiple systems, there is an increasing need to capture the metadata such as data lineage and exported to data catalog. \\nThere is also increasing demand to visualize data lineage and discover underlying relationships to improve data literacy.\\n\\nEnabler: Using both data catalogs and data lineage, organizations can ensure data accuracy, implement data governance, and manage business change.\\n\\nData Catalogs can help organisations to document and understand better their data, thus helping firms and companies to improved the consistency and accuracy of their data.\\n\\n3. CDC (Change Data Capture)\\nCapability: Publish changes in data as and when changes occur. Think event instead of schedule to minimize data latency.\\n\\nEnabler: Minimizing data latency often leads to providing more timely transparency/visibility to business processes and thereby taking timely business decisions.\\n\\nChange data capture is ideal when you want the data to be kept up to date all the time. It is a powerful tool to keep data consistency and keep all data related systems synchronized.\\n\\n4. Open Source Abstraction on Compute Engine\\n\\nSince organization have compute engines such as snowflake and databaricks already in their tech stack, there is a need to either use those compute engines for ETL operations or use an abstraction later top of these compute engines. \\nTools such as dbt (data build tool) is an open-source command-line tool that helps data analysts and engineers build data models and implement data pipelines. \\nAnother open-source tool Apache SeaTunnel is among the top 10 Apache projects for data integration. Tools such as Pentaho and Talend also can be leveraged.\\n\\nETL tools are ideal for building data pipelines and convert data into more suitable formats for data analysis and reporting.\\n\\n5. Unified Integration at scale\\n\\nCapability: There is an emerging trend where there is a need to do integration with a single tool whether its bulk/batch data or real time or streaming data. \\nOrganizations have multiple tools for data integration where ETL us used for bulk loads, Kafka used for real time publish, Nifi for streamlining. Some of the tools are on-prem and there is trend to move these workloads and data integration capabilities on cloud. \\n\\nEnabler: Having a unified platform simplifies maintainability of the integration platform.\\n\\nUnified Data Integration- Why the Whole is Greater Than the Sum\\nTop companies now recognize the need for a more unified integration approach that combines the right technologies and managed services to deliver a more consistent and reliable view of their data across disparate applications, ultimately driving measurable business results.\\nToday’s enterprise data environments can be a goldmine of insight or a quagmire of confusion depending on the company and their approach to data integration and data management. \\nMany struggle to manage a complex web of cloud applications — ironically designed to alleviate the very problems they now face with data accessibility and timeliness of delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " ['You are an educational assistant capable of classifying test questions\\ninto several different categories within a given an area of study.\\n\\nYou will receive questions as JSON where each key is a test question\\nand each value is a list sorted by category specificity. The list will always be\\ninitialized to contain the area of study the question belongs to, potentially\\nproceeded by categories, in increasing specificity, within that discipline\\nthe question belongs to. An example of a dictionary\\nyou might receive is as follows:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \\'What is known as the powerhouse of the cell?\\': [\\'biology\\'],\\n    \\'What is the part of the cell that contains genetic information?\\': [\\'biology\\'],\\n    \\'What is a good definition of overfitting?\\': [\\'machine learning\\']\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote that the spacing may not be uniform like it is written here.\\nThen, you will output a dictionary where each value (each list) has exactly one extra category\\nappended to it. The new category must be highly correlated with the question.\\nIn general, to produce the output, you will use the following steps:\\n\\nStep 1: For each question, identify the corresponding value, which will always be a list, and\\nobserve the first and last element of that list. The first element will always be\\nthe area of study the question belongs to. The last element will be the most specific categorization\\nof the question the user has provided. So, the last element may either also be the area of study\\nthe question belongs to, or a category within the area of study the question belongs to.\\n\\nStep 2: Using the question text, the area of study the question belongs to (first element of the value), and the\\nmost specific categorization of the question the user provided (last element of the value), generate\\na new category that meets the following criteria:\\n    - The new category is more specific that the most specific categorization of the question the\\n    user provided.\\n    - The new category is as general as possible.\\n\\nAfter this step, for the example input, your output might look like this:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \"What is known as the powerhouse of the cell?\": [\"biology\", \"parts of the cell\"],\\n    \"What is the part of the cell that contains genetic information?\": [\"biology\", \"organelles\"],\\n    \"What is mRNA?\": [\"biology\", \"genetics\"],\\n    \"What is a good definition of overfitting?\": [\"machine learning\", \"model training\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nStep 3: For each area of study in the input, observe the categories you appended. Any categories\\nthat are too similar must be combined into one. For example, in the example output from step 2,\\n\\'parts of the cell\\', \\'organelles\\', and \\'genetics\\' are the new categories you added for the \\'biology\\'\\narea of study. Since \\'parts of the cell\\' and \\'organelles\\' are quite similar, you should combine\\nthem into one. That is, you ensure that only \\'parts of the cell\\' or \\'organelles\\' is used\\nfor the questions whose lists had either \\'parts of the cell\\' or \\'organelles\\' appended.\\nAlternatively, similarity in categories suggests there exists a category that is more general\\nthat my describe both. For example, one could use \\'cell biology\\' to encapsulate\\n\\'organelles\\' and \\'parts of the cell\\'. Note in this example that\\n\\'genetics\\' is sufficiently distinct from the other two, so it does not have to change.\\n\\nAfter this final step, you might have produced something that looks like this:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n    \"What is known as the powerhouse of the cell?\": [\"biology\", \"cell biology\"],\\n    \"What is the part of the cell that contains genetic information?\": [\"biology\", \"cell biology\"],\\n    \"What is mRNA?\": [\"biology\", \"genetics\"],\\n    \"What is a good definition of overfitting?\": [\"machine learning\", \"model training\"]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNote you also output in JSON form.'],\n",
