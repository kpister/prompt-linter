<BEGIN_TEXT> The fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, signaled the end of the Cold War and was a pivotal moment in world history. The wall, which had divided East and West Berlin since 1961, was a symbol of the ideological divide between the Communist East and the capitalist West. Its demolition allowed for the reunification of Germany, a process that was officially completed on October 3, 1990. The event marked a shift towards greater political freedom and economic reform in Eastern Europe.

Prior to the fall, peaceful protests demanding more political freedom and transparent governance had been growing increasingly large in East Germany. The collapse of the wall was spurred by mounting pressure from these civil demonstrations as well as reforms initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. His policies of Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring) had set the stage for significant changes across the Eastern Bloc.

The tearing down of the Berlin Wall not only united a then-divided Germany but also symbolized the erosion of repressive regimes across Eastern Europe. Consequently, it prefigured the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, heralding the end of decades-long global tensions typified by the Cold War epoch. It stands today as a testament to the transformative power of collective action and the perennial quest for freedom. <END_TEXT>

The Great Wall of China, one of the greatest wonders of the world, was built over several dynasties by millions of laborers. It stretches approximately 13,170 miles across northern China and was originally conceived by Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the 3rd century B.C. as a defense against invasions. The wall has since become a symbol of China's enduring strength and architectural ingenuity. Despite its historical use, much of the wall that stands today was constructed during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). The Great Wall is not a single, continuous wall but a collection of walls and fortifications. In recent years, efforts have been made to preserve this majestic structure, which suffers from both natural and human-caused damage.

In the study, the authors apply Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development to understand how children acquire mathematical concepts. Piaget's stages of development, namely sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational, provide a framework for observing how children's thinking evolves. The study identifies that during the concrete operational stage, typically between ages 7 and 11, children develop logical thinking and can handle complex operations like addition and subtraction with greater proficiency. The authors suggest that educational strategies should be tailored to these developmental stages to enhance learning outcomes.

<BEGIN_TEXT> The application of Foucault's concept of "panopticism" provides a valuable lens through which to examine contemporary digital surveillance practices. According to Foucault, panopticism is a mechanism of power that allows for constant observation and normalization of behavior through an omnipresent but often invisible authority. Modern digital surveillance systems, such as social media monitoring and data mining, function similarly by creating an environment where individuals regulate their own actions due to the perceived omnipresence of surveillance. These practices reinforce conformity and control, echoing Foucault’s assertion that power is most effective when it is hidden.

<BEGIN_TEXT> In his seminal work, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions," Thomas Kuhn introduces the concept of paradigm shifts to explain the progression of scientific knowledge. Kuhn argues that science does not progress through a linear accumulation of knowledge but rather undergoes periodic revolutions, which he terms "paradigm shifts." These shifts occur when the prevailing framework or paradigm within which scientific inquiry operates becomes untenable due to accumulating anomalies. A new paradigm then emerges, fundamentally altering the scientific landscape and the questions considered worth investigating. This framework challenges the traditional view of science as a steady, cumulative process and has profound implications for how scientific progress is understood. <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_TEXT> The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century in Britain, marked a major turning point in history. Almost every aspect of daily life was influenced in some way. The most significant changes were in the way products were manufactured. Before the revolution, manufacturing was often done in people's homes, using hand tools or basic machines. Industrialization shifted this production to factories, where machinery powered by steam engines and later electricity could mass-produce goods. This led to an increase in production capacity and efficiency. Additionally, the revolution spurred advancements in transportation, such as the development of the steam locomotive and the expansion of the railway network, which further facilitated the movement of goods and people. The Industrial Revolution also had profound social impacts, including urbanization, changes in labor conditions, and the rise of a new social class structure. <END_TEXT>

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. **Assign a role to the large language models:** This principle involves giving the LLM a specific role to play, which can help in guiding its responses more effectively.\n\n2. **When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files:** This principle suggests generating a script to create or modify files automatically when dealing with multi-file code prompts.\n\n3. **Use output primers:** This principle involves ending the prompt with the beginning of the desired output to guide the LLM's response.\n\n4. **Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting):** This principle involves providing examples to guide the LLM on how to respond.\n\n5. **No need to be polite with LLM:** This principle suggests being direct and to the point in your prompts.\n\n6. **Specify the format of the output:** Clearly define the format you expect the output in, such as JSON, XML, or plain text.\n\n7. **Use clear and precise language:** Avoid ambiguity in your prompts to get more accurate responses.\n\n8. **Break down complex tasks:** Divide the prompt into simpler, more manageable parts.\n\n9. **Use delimiters to separate different parts of the prompt:** This helps in distinguishing between different sections of the prompt.\n\n10. **Use placeholders for dynamic content:** Use placeholders like {TEXT} to indicate where dynamic content should be inserted.\n\n11. **Ask for step-by-step solutions:** Encourage the LLM to provide detailed, step-by-step responses.\n\n12. **Emphasize important instructions:** Highlight crucial parts of the prompt to ensure they are not overlooked.\n\n13. **Limit the scope of the response:** Define the boundaries of what the response should cover.\n\n14. **Incorporate constraints:** Specify any constraints or limitations that should be considered in the response.\n\n15. **Use bullet points for lists:** This makes the prompt easier to read and follow.\n\n16. **Ask for specific types of responses:** Specify if you want a summary, a list, a code snippet, etc.\n\n17. **Provide context:** Give enough background information to make the task clear.\n\n18. **Use examples to clarify the task:** Show examples of what you are looking for.\n\n19. **Ask for verification:** Request the LLM to verify its response if applicable.\n\n20. **Encourage creativity:** Allow room for creative solutions when appropriate.\n\n21. **Ask for multiple solutions:** Request more than one possible solution to a problem.\n\n22. **Specify the level of detail:** Indicate how detailed the response should be.\n\n23. **Use conditional statements:** Specify conditions that should be met in the response.\n\n24. **Request justification:** Ask the LLM to explain its reasoning.\n\n25. **Use plain language:** Avoid jargon and complex vocabulary.\n\n26. **Iterate and refine:** Continuously improve the prompt based on the responses you get.",
