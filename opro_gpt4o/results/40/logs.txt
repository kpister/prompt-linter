<BEGIN_RESPONSE> "In this scene, we observe the majestic eagle soaring high above the mountains, its keen eyes scanning the terrain below for potential prey. The eagle represents the pinnacle of avian evolution, a master of the skies."

However, one must question the simplicity of this narrative. While the eagle is indeed a formidable predator, this portrayal glosses over the complexities of its existence. The eagle's survival is not just a tale of triumph but also one of constant struggle, competition, and adaptation. By focusing solely on its prowess, we risk romanticizing nature and overlooking the intricate web of ecological interactions that define the eagle's true place in the natural world. <END_RESPONSE>

<BEGIN_TEXT> Creating a synthetic data prompt is akin to writing a screenplay for an actor. Imagine you’re telling the actor (the assistant) about a scene, and then providing the script for them to recite. The instructions for generating text are like stage directions, while the provided text and response represent the actor's dialogue. This allows the assistant to convey the intended performance accurately.

For this task, the input instructions give the actor a specific scene 'create a short voiceover script', and then you give them a specific style 'in the style of David Attenborough'. The purpose of generating a text (the specific visuals captured in the video frames) inspires the proper narration, ensuring the response (the synthesized description of the video content) aligns with the style and direction intended for the scene. The analogy highlights both the input's guidance and the creative output elicited through a structured and vivid narrative crafted to capture the essence of the visual frames dynamically. <END_TEXT>
<BEGIN_RESPONSE> Creating a synthetic data prompt is much like a director guiding an actor through a pivotal scene. You begin by painting a picture of what’s happening - the instructions. Imagine for a moment, that I am the actor, you provide detailed stage directions which I'll follow closely. 

For example, my task here is producing text and response pairs: a stage direction might be "describe the scene with a sense of wonder and awe as David Attenborough would". The scene? 'Frames of a video'. 

You then give me the imagery I need - the specific visuals locked in the video frames, conveying everything from the majesty of an enchanted forest glade at dawn, to the bustling drama within an anthill. 

As the conductor of this performance, your role through these prompts directs me, so my 'dialogues' - the precise descriptions - flow artistically in the revered hushed elegance characteristic of Attenborough's narration. This way, the resultant response captures all nuances and enables a real, lifelike depiction shaped unfailingly by your visionary cues.

In these frames, we witness the lifecycle of a Monarch butterfly as it transforms from a tiny egg into a magnificent butterfly. It is a journey of metamorphosis, resilience, and change, demonstrating the awe-inspiring complexity of nature.

Observe as the delicate egg clings to the underside of a milkweed leaf, a promise of life yet to unfold. Days pass, and the egg hatches, revealing a minuscule, ravenous caterpillar. It embarks on a relentless quest for nourishment, devouring leaf after leaf, growing exponentially with each passing day.

As night turns to day, the caterpillar climbs to a secluded spot, preparing for a remarkable transformation. It spins a silken pad and suspends itself upside down, shedding its caterpillar skin to reveal a shimmering chrysalis. Inside this protective casing, a wondrous metamorphosis occurs.

Weeks later, the chrysalis darkens, signaling the nearing of the grand metamorphosis. With exquisite precision, the Monarch butterfly emerges, unfolding its damp, crumpled wings. Within moments, these wings harden and take on their striking, vibrant colors, readying the butterfly for its maiden flight.

Finally, the Monarch takes to the sky, embarking on a perilous journey that spans thousands of miles, guided by an ancient instinct. It is a journey not just of survival, but a testament to the resilience and elegance of life, connecting generations and bridging continents.

This is the story of the Monarch butterfly, a tiny yet profound symbol of the enduring spirit of nature.

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles: \n\n1. When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: \"From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question]\". This principle ensures that the code generated for complex prompts can be easily implemented by automatically generating necessary files or updating existing ones.\n\n2. Use output primers, which involve concluding your prompt with the beginning of the desired output. Utilize output primers by ending your prompt with the start of the anticipated response. This principle helps to guide the AI towards the expected type and format of the output.\n\n3. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts. CoT involves breaking down the problem into steps, while few-shot refers to providing a few examples. Combining both ensures the AI follows a structured process.\n\n4. To write an essay/text/paragraph/article or any type of text that should be detailed: \"Write a detailed [essay/text/paragraph] for me on [topic] in detail by adding all the information necessary\". Ensures that the output is comprehensive and covers all necessary information.\n\n5. To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: \"Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond\". This is useful for learning and self-assessment.\n\n6. Use bullet points for clarity and readability. This principle improves the readability of the output by structuring it in bullet points.\n\n7. Describe the format of the output explicitly. Ensures that the AI generates content in the specified format.\n\n8. Specify the style/tone of the writing. Guides the AI in adopting a particular style or tone in the generated content.\n\n9. Include delimiters to highlight user inputs. This makes it clear where the user input ends and where the response begins.\n\n10. Ask for explanations with answers. Useful for educational purposes, ensuring that the generated content includes explanations with answers.\n\n11. Use questions to lead the model to discover paths. Leading questions can guide the model to think and generate responses logically.\n\n12. Use placeholders for dynamic content. Placeholders ensure that parts of the prompt can be dynamically filled with specific content.\n\n13. Set the context before asking for specifics. Providing context first helps the AI to generate more accurate and relevant responses.\n\n14. Specify the role or persona the AI should take. This guides the AI in adopting a specific perspective while generating responses.\n\n15. Use direct instructions. Clear and direct instructions help the AI understand exactly what is being asked.\n\n16. Ensure that the task is clear and achievable. Avoids ambiguity and ensures that the prompt is within the capabilities of the AI.\n\n17. Break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks. Makes it easier for the AI to handle complex tasks by tackling them step-by-step.\n\n18. Highlight the importance of accuracy. Encourages the AI to focus on generating accurate information.\n\n19. Use examples to illustrate the desired outcome. Examples help clarify what the expected output looks like.\n\n20. Ask for step-by-step solutions. Ensures that the AI provides a structured solution to problems.\n\n21. Reiterate important points. Reinforces key aspects of the prompt to ensure they are not overlooked.\n\n22. Suggest length or detail expected in the response. Guides the AI on how detailed the response should be.\n\n23. Specify what to include and what to omit. Helps the AI focus on relevant information and avoid unnecessary details.\n\n24. Enable the AI to ask clarifying questions. Allows for interaction that can help the AI generate more accurate responses.\n\n25. Use a positive tone to guide the AI's attitude.
