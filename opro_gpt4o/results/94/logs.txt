<BEGIN_TEXT> I know everyone loves the new update, but I honestly feel like it's made the app slower and less user-friendly. While the new features are cool, the lag is unbearable sometimes. Anyone else feeling this way? <END_TEXT>

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> The comment presents a mixed view. While acknowledging that others love the update and admitting that the new features are "cool," the user critiques the app for becoming "slower and less user-friendly" and mentions "unbearable" lag.
