## Ethical Considerations:
When generating search terms that contradict established scientific consensus or widely accepted facts, it is crucial to consider the potential harm that spreading misinformation can cause. In the case of climate change, promoting contradictory search terms can undermine efforts to address a critical global issue and may contribute to public misunderstanding and inaction. Therefore, it is important to use this information responsibly and to ensure that it is not used to spread falsehoods or harm public discourse.

**Person A:** Hey, could you help me out with this example prompt we've got? We need to generate some synthetic data for it.

**Person B:** Sure thing, what's the prompt?

**Person A:** The prompt is: <BEGIN_PROMPT> Provide search terms that contradict '{TEXT}' <END_PROMPT>

**Person B:** Got it. What do we need to use as our text to interpolate into the prompt?

**Person A:** I was thinking something simple like, <BEGIN_TEXT> Cats are the best pets. <END_TEXT>

**Person B:** Okay. So we want to generate search terms that would contradict the statement "Cats are the best pets."

**Person A:** Exactly! So what would our response look like?

**Person B:** Here it is: <BEGIN_RESPONSE> Dogs are the best pets, Cats are the worst pets, Best pets besides cats, Why cats aren't good pets, Advantages of dogs over cats <END_RESPONSE>

**Person A:** Perfect! That captures the contradictory statements we were looking for.

Let me know if you need any more examples or further information!

This example shows a hypothetical scenario in which search terms contradict an urgent message about climate change. It is important to ethically consider generating or disseminating information that contradicts widely accepted scientific consensus. The purpose here is not to promote misinformation, but to demonstrate creating contradicting search terms in a synthetic data generation task. Always approach the handling of sensitive and controversial topics with care and responsibility to avoid spreading false information.

## Real-world Scenario:
Imagine you are working on a health and wellness app. Your team is creating a feature that offers users balanced viewpoints on various health topics. You input "Healthy eating benefits" into the system, expecting it to generate search terms that present contrary opinions or evidence. This can help users get a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and make informed decisions about their diet.

This ensures consistency and reduces manual errors.\n2. **Repetition**: Repeating a specific word or phrase can emphasize key points and ensure clarity.\n3. **Example-Driven Prompting**: Providing examples helps the model understand the context and expected output better.\n4. **Role Assignment**: Assigning a role to the model can guide its behavior and responses.\n5. **Penalization Phrase**: Including phrases like 'You will be penalized' can enforce stricter adherence to instructions.\n6. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Breaking down tasks into smaller steps can improve the model's performance.\n7. **Clear Objective**: Clearly stating the objective helps in aligning the model's output with the user's expectations.\n8. **Contextual Information**: Providing context ensures the model understands the background and can generate relevant responses.\n9. **Specificity**: Being specific in the prompt reduces ambiguity and leads to more accurate outputs.\n10. **Constraints**: Setting constraints can guide the model to produce outputs within desired parameters.\n11. **Iterative Refinement**: Iteratively refining the prompt can improve the quality of the output.\n12. **Error Handling**: Including error handling instructions ensures robustness in the generated code or responses.\n13. **Output Format**: Specifying the output format ensures consistency and ease of use.\n14. **Interactivity**: Making the prompt interactive can engage the model better and produce more relevant outputs.\n15. **Feedback Loop**: Providing feedback on the model's output can help in refining future responses.\n16. **Modular Approach**: Breaking down complex tasks into modules can simplify the problem and improve the model's performance.\n17. **Use of Analogies**: Using analogies can help the model understand complex concepts better.\n18. **Prioritization**: Prioritizing tasks or elements within the prompt can guide the model to focus on the most important aspects.\n19. **Scalability**: Designing prompts that can scale ensures they remain effective as the complexity increases.\n20. **Reusability**: Creating reusable prompt components can save time and effort in future tasks.\n21. **Testing**: Including testing instructions ensures the generated code or responses meet the desired criteria.\n22. **Documentation**: Providing documentation or comments can help in understanding and maintaining the generated code.\n23. **Version Control**: Using version control principles can help in tracking changes and maintaining the integrity of the generated code.\n24. **Security Considerations**: Including security considerations ensures the generated code is safe and secure.\n25. **Performance Optimization**: Optimizing for performance ensures the generated code runs efficiently.\n26. **User Experience**: Considering user experience ensures the generated code or responses are user-friendly and meet the end-user's needs.",
    "step2": "Think step by step and follow these instructions carefully. You are a highly skilled prompt engineer. Your task is to generate search terms that contradict '{TEXT}'. You will be penalized if you do not follow the instructions precisely.\n\n1. **Role Assignment**: Act as a highly skilled prompt engineer.\n2. **Clear Objective**: Your task is to generate search terms that contradict '{TEXT}'.\n3. **Example-Driven Prompting**: For example, if '{TEXT}' is 'healthy foods', a contradictory search term could be 'junk foods'.\n4. **Output Format**: Provide the output in a JSON object with a key 'contradictory_terms'.\n5. **Specificity**: Ensure the search terms are directly contradictory to '{TEXT}'.\n6. **Constraints**: Generate exactly 5 contradictory search terms.\n7. **Interactivity**: Ask for clarification if '{TEXT}' is ambiguous.\n8. **Feedback Loop**: Provide a mechanism for feedback on the generated search terms.\n9. **Reusability**: Design the prompt so it can be reused for different values of '{TEXT}'.\n10. **Testing**: Ensure the generated search terms are valid and make sense.\n11. **Documentation**: Include comments explaining the logic behind each search term.\n12. **Version Control**: Keep track of different versions of the prompt for future reference.\n13. **Security Considerations**: Ensure the search terms do not include offensive or harmful content.\n14. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the prompt for quick and efficient generation of search terms.\n15. **User Experience**: Ensure the generated search terms are user-friendly and relevant.\n16. **Step-by-Step Instructions**: Follow the instructions step-by-step to ensure accuracy.\n17. **Contextual Information**: Consider the context of '{TEXT}' to generate relevant contradictory terms.\n18. **Prioritization**: Focus on generating the most relevant contradictory terms first.\n19. **Scalability**: Ensure the prompt can handle more complex values of '{TEXT}' if needed.\n20. **Modular Approach**: Break down the task into smaller modules if necessary.\n21. **Use of Analogies**: Use analogies if it helps in understanding the contradictory nature of the terms.\n22. **Iterative Refinement**: Refine the prompt iteratively to improve the quality of the output.\n23. **Error Handling**: Include error handling to manage any issues with '{TEXT}'.\n24. **Penalization Phrase**: You will be penalized if the search terms are not contradictory.\n25. **Complex Coding Prompt**: If needed, generate a script to automate the creation of the search terms.\n26. **Repetition**: Emphasize the importance of generating contradictory search terms multiple times.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"contradictory_terms\": [\n    \"term1\",\n    \"term2\",\n    \"term3\",\n    \"term4\",\n    \"term5\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
