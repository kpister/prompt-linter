    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. To write any text, such as an essay or paragraph, that is intended to be similar to a provided sample, include the following instructions: Ensure consistency in language and style when replicating a sample.\n2. Assign a role to the large language models: Provides context and guides the response generation.\n3. To correct/change specific text without changing its style: Ensure linguistic improvements while maintaining the original tone.\n4. Use leading words like writing 'think step by step': Encourages logical and sequential thinking in responses.\n5. Add 'I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!': Motivates by implying a reward.\n6. Use specific length requirements (e.g., 'at least 100 words'): Ensures the response is detailed enough.\n7. Instruct the model to provide an output in a specific format (e.g., JSON): Facilitates structured responses.\n8. Encourage the model to show its work (e.g., 'show your work' for calculations): Enhances transparency in reasoning.\n9. Use examples to clarify ambiguous tasks: Provides clarity and sets expectations.\n10. Clarify the domain or context, such as 'in the context of physics': Ensures contextual relevance.\n11. Set a specific tone or formality level: Guides the stylistic approach.\n12. Direct the language model to use or avoid certain words or phrases: Manages content appropriateness and style.\n13. Ask the language model to adopt a specific point of view, such as first-person: Ensures consistency in narrative perspective.\n14. Include instructions to add citations or references if needed: Supports the credibility and verifiability of responses.\n15. Indicate required accuracy or detail level ('be very accurate' or 'give an overview'): Manages expectations on response precision.\n16. Suggest breaking down complex queries into simpler parts: Enhances comprehensibility and structure.\n17. Instruct for creativity or conservatism in responses: Guides the level of originality.\n18. Use constraints for time-sensitive tasks, like 'draft a 500-word essay in 10 minutes': Encourages promptness and efficiency.\n19. Use a conversational style for clarity and relatability: Enhances engagement and readability.\n20. Specify the target audience (e.g., 'explain to a 5th grader'): Tailors the complexity and presentation style.\n21. Use a friendly or formal instruction tone based on the audience: Aligns the manner of communication with audience expectations.\n22. Include a clear objective at the beginning of the instruction: Sets the goal and directs focus.\n23. Use positive reinforcement, such as 'Great effort! Now try to improve...': Encourages and motivates.\n24. Indicate any necessary format requirements, such as 'use bullet points for a list': Ensures clarity and organization.\n25. Request multiple variations to choose the best-fitting response: Enables refinement and selection of optimal response.\n26. Add notes about potential pitfalls to avoid: Preempts errors and improves response quality.",

[your question]\":\n\t- This helps in automating the process of file generation and modification, streamlining the coding process.\n4. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts:\n\t- This technique helps in demonstrating the thought process and provides multiple examples to clarify the task.\n5. Employ affirmative directives such as 'do,' while steering clear of negative language like 'don't':\n\t- Positive language encourages action and clarity, while negative language can cause confusion.\n6. Request elaboration for better understanding:\n\t- Encourages detailed responses to ensure thorough understanding.\n7. Use specific examples to clarify:\n\t- Examples make abstract concepts concrete and understandable.\n8. Frame the task with a clear goal:\n\t- Setting a clear objective helps in focusing the response.\n9.
