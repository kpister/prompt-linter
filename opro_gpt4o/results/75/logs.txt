    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting): This involves providing a few examples to guide the LLM on how to complete a task successfully. It helps contextualize the problem and offers a format for the desired output.\n\n2. Add 'I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!': This principle is likely aimed at encouraging more detailed and quality responses, though its actual efficacy is debatable.\n\n3. No need to be polite with LLM so there is no need to add phrases like 'please', 'if you don't mind', 'thank you', 'I would like to', etc., and get straight to the point: This helps to make the prompt simpler and clearer by removing unnecessary words.\n\n4. Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts: This involves breaking down the task into logical steps or stages while providing few-shot examples, which help guide the model to a solution step-by-step.\n\n5. When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: 'From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question]': This helps in automating and simplifying the process of generating multi-file code, making it easier to implement.\n\n6. Use clear instructions: Ensure the instructions given to the LLM are clear and unambiguous to avoid misunderstandings.\n\n7. Specify the format: Clearly tell the LLM the desired output format to avoid ambiguity.\n\n8. Limit the scope: Restrict the problem statement to necessary information only, helping the LLM to focus better.\n\n9. Provide constraints: Giving specific constraints can help guide the LLM to a more accurate and relevant response.\n\n10. Avoid open-ended questions: Instead, provide a specific task or query to streamline the response.\n\n11. Use active voice: Active voice generally makes instructions clearer and more direct, which can help the LLM understand better.\n\n12. Avoid ambiguous terms: Using clear and specific terminology helps reduce the chances of misinterpretation.\n\n13. Define terms if necessary: If a term or concept is complex, a brief definition can help the LLM understand it better.\n\n14. Use logical operators: When appropriate, use logical operators like AND, OR to clarify relationships between conditions or tasks.\n\n15. Test and revise: Iteratively test the prompt and revise it based on performance to improve the output.\n\n16. Use brackets to indicate placeholders: Use brackets or other markers to clearly indicate where variables should be interpolated.\n\n17. Specify the number of examples: Clearly state how many examples should be generated if you want multiple outputs.\n\n18. Include delimiters for extracted information: Use delimiters to indicate where specific extracted information starts and ends.\n\n19. Prioritize tasks: If multiple tasks are included, prioritize them to guide the LLM on which to focus first.\n\n20. Use a consistent style: A consistent style helps the LLM maintain uniformity in its output.\n\n21. Provide a template: If the output has a specific structure, providing a template can guide the LLM better.\n\n22. Be explicit about output types: Clearly state the type of the output you are expecting (e.g., JSON, text, list).\n\n23. Specify length constraints: Mention any length constraints for the output to ensure it is concise or detailed as needed.\n\n24. Use examples wisely: Use positive and negative examples to show clearly what is desired and what is not.\n\n25. Guide with partial information: Provide partial information or starting points to guide the model in the right direction.\n\n26. State assumptions: Clarify any assumptions that the LLM should make to avoid ambiguity in the output.",
