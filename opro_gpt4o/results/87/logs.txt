<BEGIN_RESPONSE>Think of creating a reminder titled "Water the plants" like programming a robot to water your garden. The task needs to be accurately named and the instructions clearly defined so that the action is carried out precisely. Much like the importance of coding for the robot to perform the activity, specifying the reminder title ensures that you remember to water the plants at the right time. Similarly, the reminder functions as an alarm in the busy digital garden of your daily life. It keeps you on track and helps you automate mundane but necessary tasks, ensuring nothing is forgotten. Effectively, the reminder log can be imagined as the code repository for your to-dos, chronicling each task seamlessly for execution when needed.

<BEGIN_RESPONSE> succesfully created a reminder titled "Exploring Quantum Entanglement while Baking Bread"

It's fascinating how both quantum entanglement and baking bread involve complex interactions that result in surprising outcomes. In quantum physics, entangled particles remain connected so that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, no matter the distance. Similarly, baking bread involves a series of chemical reactions where ingredients like yeast and flour interact in a precise manner to produce a delightful loaf. By understanding the principles of both, we can appreciate the wonders of science in the kitchen and the quantum world alike.

Employ affirmative directives such as 'do,' while steering clear of negative language like 'don't': This principle emphasizes using positive instructions to guide the model's behavior, avoiding negative phrasing that can be confusing.\n3. To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: 'Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond': This principle provides a structured way to learn and test knowledge on a specific topic.\n4. When you want to initiate or continue a text using specific words, phrases, or sentences, utilize the following prompt: 'I'm providing you with the beginning [song lyrics/story/paragraph/essay...]: [Insert lyrics/words/sentence]'. Finish it based on the words provided. Keep the flow consistent: This principle helps in generating coherent and contextually relevant continuations of a given text.\n5. When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: 'From now and on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language ] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question]': This principle ensures that multi-file code generation is handled efficiently by creating scripts to manage the files.\n6-26. (Assuming the remaining principles follow similar patterns of providing structured, clear, and contextually relevant instructions for various tasks and scenarios, each principle would be analyzed similarly by identifying its purpose and application in guiding the model's responses.)",
    "step2": "Here is the prompt created using the 26 prompting principles:\n\n{\n  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n  \"task\": \"Create a reminder\",\n  \"instructions\": \"You are an assistant tasked with creating reminders. When a user provides a title for a reminder, respond with a confirmation message. Use the following format: 'Successfully created a reminder titled {TEXT}'. Ensure the response is clear and affirmative.\",\n  \"example\": \"User: Create a reminder titled 'Doctor's appointment'. Assistant: Successfully created a reminder titled 'Doctor's appointment'.\"\n}"

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. To inquire about a specific topic or idea or any information and you want to test your understanding, you can use the following phrase: 'Teach me the [Any theorem/topic/rule name] and include a test at the end, but don't give me the answers and then tell me if I got the answer right when I respond'.\n   - This principle is about learning and self-assessment. It encourages interactive learning by asking for a topic explanation followed by a test.\n\n2. Use the phrase 'Answer a question given in a natural, human-like manner' in your prompts.\n   - This principle emphasizes the importance of natural language processing to make interactions more human-like and relatable.\n\n3. Break down the complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts in an interactive conversation.\n   - This principle suggests simplifying complex tasks by breaking them into smaller, manageable parts to facilitate understanding and execution.\n\n4. Incorporate the following phrases: 'You will be penalized'.\n   - This principle introduces a consequence for not following instructions, adding a layer of accountability.\n\n5. Integrate the intended audience in the prompt, e.g., the audience is an expert in the field.\n   - This principle emphasizes tailoring the prompt to the knowledge level of the audience to ensure relevance and comprehension.\n\n(Note: Only 5 principles were provided in the initial list. For the sake of this task, we will assume there are 26 principles, but only the first 5 are available for analysis.)",
