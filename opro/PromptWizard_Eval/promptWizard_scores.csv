[ Question ] Tim rides his bike back and forth to work for each of his 5
workdays . His work is 20 miles away . He also goes for a weekend
bike ride of 200 miles . If he can bike at 25 mph how much time
does he spend biking a week ?
[ Answer ] 1. Identify the key pieces of information : Tim bikes to work
and back for 5 days , his work is 20 miles away , he goes for a 200 -
mile bike ride on the weekend , and his biking speed is 25 mph .
2. Understand that the problem involves a sequence of events : Tim ’ s
daily commute to work and back , and his weekend bike ride .
3. Calculate the total distance Tim bikes to work and back in a week :
20 miles to work * 2 ( for the return trip ) = 40 miles per day .
Multiply this by 5 days : 40 miles / day * 5 days = 200 miles .
4. Add the distance of Tim ’ s weekend bike ride to the total distance
he bikes to work : 200 miles ( work ) + 200 miles ( weekend ) = 400
miles .
5. Understand that the problem asks for the total time Tim spends
biking in a week , and that time can be calculated by dividing
distance by speed .
6. Calculate the total time Tim spends biking in a week : 400 miles ÷
25 mph = 16 hours .
7. Verify that the answer is logical : Tim spends 16 hours biking in a
week , which is reasonable given the distances and speed provided .
8. The final answer is 16 hours . < ANS_START >16 < ANS_END >
[ Question ] Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95 . He has
been saving up his money each month for the past three months . He
gets a $5 allowance a month . He also mows lawns and shovels
driveways . He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel . After
buying the shoes , he has $15 in change . If he mows 4 lawns , how
many driveways did he shovel ?
[ Answer ] 1. Identify the total amount of money Tobias had before
buying the shoes . This is given by the cost of the shoes plus the
change he has left , which is $95 + $15 = $110 .
2. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias earned from his
allowance . He gets $5 a month and has been saving for three months
, so he earned $5 * 3 = $15 from his allowance .
3. Calculate the total amount of money Tobias earned from mowing lawns
. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and he mowed 4 lawns , so he earned
$15 * 4 = $60 from mowing lawns .
4. Subtract the money Tobias earned from his allowance and mowing
lawns from the total amount of money he had before buying the
shoes . This will give us the amount of money he earned from
shoveling driveways . So , $110 - $15 - $60 = $35 is the amount he
earned from shoveling driveways .
5. Finally , divide the total amount of money Tobias earned from
shoveling driveways by the amount he charges to shovel one
driveway . This will give us the number of driveways he shoveled .
So , $35 / $7 = 5 driveways . < ANS_START >5 < ANS_END >

truck stamps than snowflake stamps , and 13 fewer rose stamps than
truck stamps . How many stamps did Bella buy in all ?
[ Answer ] 1. Identify the quantities given in the problem : Bella bought
11 snowflake stamps .
2. Understand the relationships between the different types of stamps :
She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps , and 13
fewer rose stamps than truck stamps .
3. Calculate the number of truck stamps : The number of truck stamps is
11 ( snowflake stamps ) + 9 = 20.
4. Calculate the number of rose stamps : The number of rose stamps is
20 ( truck stamps ) - 13 = 7.
5. Add up all the stamps : The total number of stamps Bella bought is
11 ( snowflake stamps ) + 20 ( truck stamps ) + 7 ( rose stamps ) = 38.
6. Verify the answer : Check that the total number of stamps (38)
matches the sum of the individual quantities of each type of stamp
(11 snowflake stamps , 20 truck stamps , 7 rose stamps ) . The answer
is correct . < ANS_START >38 < ANS_END >

[ Question ] Tina makes $18 .00 an hour . If she works more than 8 hours
per shift , she is eligible for overtime , which is paid by your
hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage . If she works 10 hours every
day for 5 days , how much money does she make ?
[ Answer ] 1. Identify the key information : Tina ’ s hourly wage is \ $18
.00 , she works 10 hours a day for 5 days , and overtime is
calculated as the hourly wage plus half the hourly wage for hours
worked over 8 hours in a shift .
2. Calculate the regular pay : Tina works 10 hours a day , but only 8
hours are considered regular hours . So , for 5 days , she works 8
hours / day * 5 days = 40 hours .
3. Multiply the regular hours by the hourly wage to get the regular
pay : 40 hours * $18 .00/ hour = $720 .00.
4. Calculate the overtime hours : Tina works 10 hours a day , so she has
10 hours / day - 8 hours / day = 2 hours / day of overtime . Over 5 days
, this is 2 hours / day * 5 days = 10 hours of overtime .
5. Calculate the overtime wage : The overtime wage is the hourly wage
plus half the hourly wage , so $18 .00/ hour + 0.5 * $18 .00/ hour =
$27 .00/ hour .
6. Multiply the overtime hours by the overtime wage to get the
overtime pay : 10 hours * $27 .00/ hour = $270 .00.
7. Add the regular pay and the overtime pay to get the total pay : $720
.00 + $270 .00 = $990 .00.
8. Verify the answer : Tina makes $990 .00 if she works 10 hours a day
for 5 days , with overtime pay for hours worked over 8 hours in a
shift . This is logical and matches the original problem . <

[ Question ] Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than Bobbie ’ s
last name . If Bobbie took two letters off her last name , she would
have a last name twice the length of Jamie ’ s . Jamie ’ s full name
is Jamie Grey . How many letters are in Samantha ’ s last name ?
[ Answer ] 1. Start by identifying the key pieces of information from
the problem : Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than
Bobbie ’ s last name , and if Bobbie took two letters off her last
name , she would have a last name twice the length of Jamie ’ s.
Jamie ’ s full name is Jamie Grey .
2. From the information given , we know that Jamie ’ s last name is Grey ,
which has 4 letters .
3. Since Bobbie ’s last name , after removing two letters , is twice the
length of Jamie ’ s last name , we can set up the equation : ( Bobbie ’ s
last name length - 2) = 2 * Jamie ’ s last name length .
4. Substituting the known value of Jamie ’ s last name length (4) into
the equation gives : ( Bobbie ’ s last name length - 2) = 2 * 4 , which
simplifies to Bobbie ’ s last name length - 2 = 8.
5. Solving for Bobbie ’ s last name length gives : Bobbie ’ s last name
length = 8 + 2 = 10.
6. We know that Samantha ’ s last name has three fewer letters than
Bobbie ’ s last name . So , we can set up the equation : Samantha ’ s
last name length = Bobbie ’ s last name length - 3.
7. Substituting the known value of Bobbie ’ s last name length (10) into
the equation gives : Samantha ’ s last name length = 10 - 3.
8. Solving for Samantha ’ s last name length gives : Samantha ’ s last name
length = 7.
9. Therefore , Samantha ’ s last name has 7 letters . < ANS_START >7 < ANS_END

[ Question ] A 70 - year - old man presents with a 1 - year history of
progressive memory loss , difficulty finding words , and getting
lost in familiar places . Neurologic examination shows impaired
recall and disorientation to time and place . MRI of the brain
shows cortical atrophy and enlarged ventricles . Which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis ?
Options :
A : Alzheimer ’ s disease
B : Vascular dementia
C : Lewy body dementia
D : Frontotemporal dementia

[ Answer ] 1. Start by analyzing the patient ’ s age , symptoms , duration
and onset of symptoms , and the results of the physical examination
and diagnostic tests . The patient is a 70 - year - old man with a 1 -
year history of progressive memory loss , difficulty finding words ,
and getting lost in familiar places . The neurologic examination
shows impaired recall and disorientation to time and place . The
MRI of the brain shows cortical atrophy and enlarged ventricles .
2. Consider the progression , severity , and duration of the patient ’ s
symptoms . The symptoms have been progressing over a year , which
indicates a chronic condition .
3. Use your medical knowledge to identify the most likely diagnosis .
The symptoms of progressive memory loss , difficulty finding words ,
and getting lost in familiar places , along with impaired recall
and disorientation to time and place , are characteristic of a
neurodegenerative disease .
4. Look at the answer options and eliminate incorrect ones based on
your medical knowledge . Vascular dementia ( Option B) typically
presents with stepwise deterioration of cognitive function , which
is not the case here . Lewy body dementia ( Option C ) is usually
accompanied by visual hallucinations , parkinsonism , or fluctuating
cognition , none of which are mentioned in the question .
Frontotemporal dementia ( Option D ) often presents with changes in
personality and behavior , which is also not mentioned in the
question .
5. The remaining option is Alzheimer ’ s disease ( Option A ) , which is a
neurodegenerative disease that commonly presents with progressive
memory loss , difficulty finding words , and getting lost in
familiar places , especially in older adults . The MRI findings of
cortical atrophy and enlarged ventricles are also consistent with
Alzheimer ’ s disease .
6. Validate your answer by ensuring it aligns with all the information
provided in the question . Alzheimer ’ s disease fits with the
patient ’s age , the chronic and progressive nature of the symptoms ,
the neurologic examination findings , and the MRI results .
7. Therefore , the correct answer is A : Alzheimer ’ s disease . < ANS_START
>A < ANS_END >


[ Question ] A 35 - year - old woman presents with a 2 - week history of
severe headache , fever , and photophobia . She also reports a rash
on her lower extremities . Physical examination reveals a
temperature of 38.2◦
C (100.8◦
F ) , a heart rate of 110/ min , and a
petechial rash on her lower extremities . Lumbar puncture shows
increased white blood cells with a predominance of lymphocytes ,
increased protein , and normal glucose . Which of the following is
the most appropriate pharmacotherapy ?
Options :
A : Ceftriaxone and vancomycin
B : Acyclovir
C : Amphotericin B
D : Doxycycline

[ Answer ] 1. Start by analyzing the patient ’ s symptoms : severe headache
, fever , photophobia , and a petechial rash on her lower
extremities . These symptoms suggest a systemic infection , possibly
involving the central nervous system given the presence of
headache and photophobia .
2. Consider the patient ’ s age and duration of symptoms . A 35 - year - old
woman with a 2 - week history of these symptoms suggests an acute
infection rather than a chronic condition .
3. Review the physical examination findings and diagnostic test
results . The patient has a fever and tachycardia , further
supporting the presence of a systemic infection . The lumbar
puncture results show increased white blood cells with a
predominance of lymphocytes , increased protein , and normal glucose
. These findings are indicative of viral meningitis .
4. Evaluate the answer options in relation to the most likely
diagnosis . Viral meningitis is typically caused by enteroviruses ,
herpes simplex virus , or arboviruses .
5. Option A ( Ceftriaxone and vancomycin ) is used to treat bacterial
meningitis , which is not consistent with the lumbar puncture
results . Eliminate this option .
6. Option B ( Acyclovir ) is an antiviral medication used to treat
infections caused by herpes viruses , including herpes simplex
virus meningitis . This option aligns with the diagnosis .
7. Option C ( Amphotericin B ) is an antifungal medication , which is not
consistent with the diagnosis of viral meningitis . Eliminate this
option .
8. Option D ( Doxycycline ) is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial
infections , including certain types of bacterial meningitis , but
it is not the first - line treatment for viral meningitis . Eliminate
this option .
 Validate the final choice ( Option B : Acyclovir ) by ensuring it
aligns with all the information provided in the question ,
including the patient ’ s age , symptoms , physical examination
findings , and specific diagnostic test results .
10. Therefore , the correct answer is B : Acyclovir . < ANS_START >B <

[ Question ] A 40 - year - old man with a history of alcohol abuse presents
with a 1 - day history of severe abdominal pain , nausea , and
vomiting . Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen ,
decreased bowel sounds , and tenderness to palpation in the upper
abdomen . Laboratory tests show an elevated serum amylase and
lipase . Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis ?
Options :
A : Acute pancreatitis
B : Peptic ulcer disease
C : Gastric cancer
D : Gastroenteritis

[ Answer ] 1. Start by analyzing the patient ’ s age , symptoms , duration
and onset of symptoms , history of present illness , lifestyle
factors , physical examination findings , and any diagnostic test
results presented in the question . The patient is a 40 - year - old
man with a history of alcohol abuse . He has been experiencing
severe abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting for 1 day . His abdomen
is distended , bowel sounds are decreased , and there is tenderness
in the upper abdomen . His serum amylase and lipase levels are
elevated .
2. Use your knowledge of medicine to identify the most likely
diagnosis . The patient ’ s history of alcohol abuse , the sudden
onset and severity of his symptoms , and his physical examination
findings are all indicative of a pancreatic condition . The
elevated serum amylase and lipase levels further support this , as
these enzymes are produced by the pancreas and their levels
increase in the blood when the pancreas is inflamed or damaged .
3. Consider the answer options in relation to the patient ’ s symptoms
and test results . Acute pancreatitis , peptic ulcer disease ,
gastric cancer , and gastroenteritis are all potential diagnoses .
4. Eliminate incorrect answer options based on your medical knowledge .
Peptic ulcer disease typically presents with a burning pain in
the middle or upper stomach between meals or at night , not with a
distended abdomen and decreased bowel sounds . Gastric cancer
usually develops slowly over many years , and its symptoms often
only appear in the advanced stages of the disease . Gastroenteritis
, while it can cause abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting , does
not typically result in a distended abdomen , decreased bowel
sounds , or elevated serum amylase and lipase levels .
5. The remaining option , acute pancreatitis , aligns with all the
information provided in the question . The patient ’ s history of
alcohol abuse is a common risk factor for acute pancreatitis . The
sudden onset and severity of his symptoms , his physical
examination findings , and his elevated serum amylase and lipase
levels are all characteristic of this condition .
6. Therefore , the most likely diagnosis for this patient is acute
pancreatitis , making option A the correct answer . < ANS_START >A <
