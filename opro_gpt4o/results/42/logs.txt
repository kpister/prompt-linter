Combine Chain-of-thought (CoT) with few-Shot prompts: This principle suggests combining prompts that guide the model through a logical reasoning process (Chain-of-thought) with examples (few-shot) to help the model understand the task.\n\n2. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in order to produce content, in the form of keywords, regulations, hint, or instructions: Provide explicit instructions or keywords to guide the model's output.\n\n3. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts: This principle suggests using specific framing to simplify explanations.\n\n4. Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting): Use examples to demonstrate the desired output to the model.\n\n5. Add 'I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!': This principle suggests incentivizing the model to produce higher-quality outputs by implying a reward.\n\n6. Use zero-shot learning when the task is simple and straightforward: Rely on the model's pre-existing knowledge without additional examples for simple tasks.\n\n7. Use multi-turn conversation for complex tasks: Break down complex tasks into a series of interactions to help the model understand the context better.\n\n8. Leverage the model's capability to generate multiple responses and select the best one: Generate multiple responses and choose the most appropriate one.\n\n9. Ensure the instructions are detailed and specific to avoid ambiguity: Provide clear and precise instructions to minimize misunderstandings.\n\n10. Use role-playing to set a context: Assign a role to the model to guide its responses (e.g., 'Act as a teacher').\n\n11. Utilize conditional statements to guide the model: Use 'if-then' statements to direct the model's behavior.\n\n12. Encourage creativity and exploration in responses: Prompt the model to think outside the box and offer creative solutions.\n\n13. Use analogies and metaphors to explain complex ideas: Help the model simplify and convey complex concepts through analogies and metaphors.\n\n14. Implement iterative refinement: Allow the model to refine its responses through multiple iterations for improved accuracy.\n\n15. Incorporate domain-specific jargon where appropriate: Use industry-specific language to ensure the model's responses are relevant to the context.\n\n16. Include constraints and boundaries to guide the model's output: Set limitations to keep the model's responses within the desired scope.\n\n17. Use positive and negative examples to differentiate good and bad outputs: Show both good and bad examples to help the model understand the difference.\n\n18. Utilize summarization techniques for concise responses: Encourage the model to provide brief and to-the-point answers.\n\n19. Leverage the model's knowledge base for factual accuracy: Ensure the model uses its knowledge base to provide accurate information.\n\n20. Guide the model with sequential steps for step-by-step tasks: Break down tasks into smaller steps to guide the model's process.\n\n21. Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses: Ask questions that prompt the model to provide elaborate answers.\n\n22. Incorporate humor and personality where suitable: Add a touch of humor and personality to make the responses more engaging.\n\n23. Encourage the model to ask clarifying questions when needed: Allow the model to seek additional information to clarify ambiguous prompts.\n\n24. Use contextual clues to maintain coherence in multi-turn interactions: Ensure the model maintains the context throughout a series of interactions.\n\n25. Provide feedback on incorrect or suboptimal responses: Give feedback to help the model learn from its mistakes and improve future outputs.\n\n26. Balance specificity and generality based on task complexity: Adjust the level of detail in the instructions depending on the complexity of the task.",

    "step1": "Here is the analysis and explanation for each of the 26 prompting principles:\n\n1. Add 'I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!': This principle incentivizes the responder to provide a high-quality solution by offering a monetary reward.\n\n2. Employ affirmative directives such as 'do,' while steering clear of negative language like 'don't': Using positive language encourages action and clarity.\n\n3. Implement example-driven prompting (Use few-shot prompting): Providing examples helps guide the responder to the desired format and quality of the answer.\n\n4. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize specific prompts for simplification: These prompts help break down complex ideas into more understandable terms.\n\n5. Use Delimiters: Delimiters clearly define the boundaries of the prompt, helping to avoid ambiguity.\n\n6. Be specific and clear about what you want: Clear instructions help the responder understand exactly what is required.\n\n7. Use open-ended questions to encourage detailed responses: Open-ended questions allow for more comprehensive answers.\n\n8. Provide context or background information: Context helps the responder tailor the answer to the specific situation.\n\n9. Use step-by-step instructions: Breaking down tasks into steps makes them easier to follow and execute.\n\n10. Ask for different perspectives or approaches: This encourages creativity and diverse solutions.\n\n11. Encourage critical thinking by asking 'why' or 'how': These questions prompt deeper analysis and reasoning.\n\n12. Use 'what if' scenarios to explore possibilities: This helps in considering alternative solutions or outcomes.\n\n13. Specify the format of the response: This ensures the answer is in the desired format.\n\n14. Use analogies or metaphors to explain complex ideas: These make complex concepts more relatable and understandable.\n\n15. Ask for pros and cons to evaluate options: This helps in weighing different solutions.\n\n16. Request summaries to condense information: Summarizing helps in capturing the essence of the information.\n\n17. Use visual aids or diagrams if possible: Visuals can enhance understanding.\n\n18. Encourage the use of examples or case studies: Real-world examples make the information more practical.\n\n19. Ask for a comparison to highlight differences: Comparisons can clarify distinctions between options.\n\n20. Request a step-by-step guide or tutorial: Detailed guides help in executing tasks accurately.\n\n21. Use hypothetical questions to explore scenarios: Hypotheticals can reveal potential outcomes and solutions.\n\n22. Encourage the use of bullet points or lists for clarity: Lists make information easier to read and digest.\n\n23. Ask for predictions or forecasts: This helps in planning and anticipating future outcomes.\n\n24. Request a critique or review: Critiques can provide valuable feedback and insights.\n\n25. Use 'if-then' statements to explore conditional scenarios: These help in understanding dependencies and consequences.\n\n26. Encourage the responder to ask questions if something is unclear: This ensures mutual understanding and clarity.",

Current Best score: 100.0
Current Best prompt: 
Act as an expert Python developer. Your task is to create a Python list of strings from the given text. Think step by step and follow these principles: 

1. Each word in the text should be an individual string within the list.
2. Ignore punctuation and special characters.
3. Preserve the order of words as they appear in the text.

The text is {TEXT}. Ensure your answer is formatted as a Python list of strings. Here is an example of the expected output:

### Example ###
Input: The text is 'Hello world'.
Output: ['Hello', 'world']
