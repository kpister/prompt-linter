    In the heart of an ancient forest, where the trees whisper secrets of old, a remarkable discovery was made. Researchers unearthed an intricate network of underground fungi that connects every tree, bush, and plant in a complex web of communication. This mycelial network, often referred to as the "Wood Wide Web," allows plants to exchange nutrients and information, fostering a harmonious ecosystem. The study highlights how these fungal networks not only aid in the survival of individual plants but also contribute to the resilience and adaptability of the entire forest. Through detailed analysis and observation, the paper delves into the symbiotic relationship between fungi and flora, illustrating how this underground alliance is crucial for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.

Add to your prompt the following phrase 'Ensure that your answer is unbiased and does not rely on stereotypes.' This principle ensures that the generated output remains neutral and objective.\n\n2. To correct/change specific text without changing its style: 'Try to revise every paragraph sent by users. You should only improve the user's grammar and vocabulary and make sure it sounds natural. You should not change the writing style, such as making a formal paragraph casual.' This principle helps improve the readability and professionalism of the text without altering its original tone.\n\n3. Clearly state the requirements that the model must follow in order to produce content, in the form of the keywords, regulations, hint, or instructions. This principle ensures that the model generates content that meets specific guidelines or objectives.\n\n4. When you have a complex coding prompt that may be in different files: 'From now on whenever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a [programming language] script that can be run to automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code. [your question].' This principle ensures that multi-file coding tasks are handled efficiently.\n\n5. When you need clarity or a deeper understanding of a topic, idea, or any piece of information, utilize the following prompts:\n    - Explain [insert specific topic] in simple terms.\n    - Explain to me like I'm 11 years old.\n    - Explain to me as if I'm a beginner in [field].\n    - Write the [essay/text/paragraph] using simple English like you're explaining something to a 5-year-old.\nThese prompts help in breaking down complex topics into simpler, more understandable segments.\n\n6. Specify the tone or style in which the output should be written, such as formal, casual, or technical. This principle helps tailor the output to the intended audience or purpose.\n\n7. Provide context or background information when asking for content generation. This enhances the relevance and accuracy of the generated content.\n\n8. Define the structure or format of the expected output, such as bullet points, numbered lists, or paragraphs. This helps in organizing the information effectively.\n\n9. Use examples to illustrate the type of response you are looking for. This provides a clear reference for the model.\n\n10. Request the model to include specific key points or details in its response. This ensures that critical information is included.\n\n11. Ask the model to generate multiple versions of the same content. This allows for comparison and selection of the best output.\n\n12. Specify any constraints or limitations, such as word count or character limit. This ensures that the generated content fits within specified parameters.\n\n13. Request the model to cite sources or provide references if necessary. This adds credibility to the generated content.\n\n14. Use follow-up questions to refine or expand on the initial response. This helps in gaining more detailed insights.\n\n15. Ask the model to summarize or condense information. This helps in creating concise versions of lengthy texts.\n\n16. Request the model to analyze or interpret data or content. This helps in gaining deeper insights or understanding.\n\n17. Ask the model to compare and contrast different ideas, concepts, or items. This helps in highlighting similarities and differences.\n\n18. Request the model to provide pros and cons or advantages and disadvantages. This helps in evaluating different aspects of a topic.\n\n19. Ask the model to make predictions or forecasts based on given data or trends. This helps in anticipating future outcomes.\n\n20.
