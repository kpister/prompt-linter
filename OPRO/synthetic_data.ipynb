       "  'answer': 'Let x be the number of years it takes to double the value of the CD.\\nAfter x years, the value of the CD will be 180*2 = 360.\\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P*(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the interest rate, n is the number of times per year that the interest is compounded, and t is the number of years.\\nIn this case, r = 5, n = 1, and P = 180.\\nSo, we have 360 = 180*(1 + 5/100)^(1*t).\\nDividing both sides by 180, we get 2 = (1 + 5/100)^t.\\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get ln(2) = t*ln(1 + 5/100).\\nSolving for t, we get t = ln(2)/ln(1 + 5/100) = <<ln(2)/ln(1+5/100)=14>>14 years.\\n#### 14'},\n",
